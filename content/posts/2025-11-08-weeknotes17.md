A light week for notes. I'm still unpacking and settling in at the new place. I am writing the notes a bit early, but this weekend is the first recording for the podcast from the new place. I'm looking forward to seeing how it goes.

## Tinkering

* I finally plugged in the big network switch I got from a coworker. I don't think it's going to be a good fit. It's just too loud.
* The wifi situation is awful at the new place and there's no good way to get ethernet by the desk. Looks like I'll be spending a little time working out a longer-range wifi setup. I've still got the network equipment from the old house, so maybe I try that stuff first and if it doesn't work straight away we get a second AP to use as a bridge or repeater.
* I upgraded my editing process for the podcast. It won't help in every episode, but for those it will help, the process improvements will make it significantly faster to edit. A massive thanks to Mike over in the TWG discord for his excellent guide.
* Speaking of the podcast, it's got a [snazzy new site!](https://twcr-radio.online/) A huge thanks to AJ for helping us with the move to Transistor.fm!
* I haven't started in earnest yet, but I did download the slicer for my dad's Prusa 3D printer. I'm excited to start making things with it.

## Playing

* Still making my way through Alan Wake II. I finished the Lake House DLC on Thursday night and enjoyed being back in a Federal Bureau of Control location. It made me really excited for an eventual Control 2. Otherwise AWII is going well. I feel close to the end of the game. I've enjoyed ti quite a lot and am excited to see where the story leads.

## Watching

Last night we started Twin Peaks the Return.
