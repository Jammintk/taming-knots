I did some development work on Tk-web.top today during some downtime at work. I've added two pages to the main navigation at the top of the page, [Connections](/pages/connections) and [Uses](/pages/uses). I've also taken the opportunity to order the pages in the header to make the order make more sense.

The Connections page is for blogs and other more ongoing media that makes more sense to place in a dedicated page rather than constantly write about them in weeknotes over and over again. I'll try to update the page over time with more blogs, youtube channels, and podcasts.

The Uses page I don't particularly like the name of, but I like the concept of quite a bit. It's a sort of snapshot into the devices and tools I use on a day to day basis right now. As things change, I'll be updating the lists. It's also a good place to put out an intention of replacing tools I like less than I used to for whatever reason.

I plan on adding more of these slashpages over time, but I may not always make the links public. It might be a fun little easter egg for folks.
