* I've had a tough week. A death in the family last weekend has left me drained and unable to focus. We weren't what I would call close, so I feel very strange about it. We didn't have an antagonistic relationship, we just weren't close.
* Because of this, I've had weird ups and downs in my energy and ability to do things. Smaller tasks seem to be working better, but I've been too exhausted to do anything for multiple days.
