Loco Motive is a murder mystery point an click adventure game in the style of old LucasArts adventure games released late last year. I played the game in its entirety last week and had a great time with it.

A constant point of consternation for me is how poor the puzzle logic of an adventure game in this style can be and how much that can affect my progress. I did have to turn to a guide three times in my playthrough, but for the rest of the game, the in- game hints were good enough.

The game is completely voice acted, which is an impressive feat, and the entire cast has done a wonderful job. Each character feels believable in this heightened reality, and they bounce off of each other really well. To this end, the writing is also very good, with plenty of funny moments and lines.

The voices would fall flat if it weren't for the very expressive art. While this could have easily been fully illustrated, I feel like the pixel aesthetic works really well for the game and has a ton of personality.

This one gets a big recommendation from me!
