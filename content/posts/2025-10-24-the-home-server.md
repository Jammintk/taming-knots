Long time no see!

I've heard enough interest in the fabled home server that I decided I'd like to push a little update to the blog about it, especially since I am *finally* at a stable spot with it where I feel good about all of the  services and everything. I don't forsee myself rolling out any new services or tools in the near future and I have figured out solutions to some of the gaps I had in my setup so now I'm fully ready to share.

## Why the Home Server?

For a long time now, I have been feeling frustrated by my reliance on companies hosting the data that I own. Yes, having the backup in someone else's hands is nice, but that is heavily offset by the required trust that I would need to have in that company to keep that data safe from malicious attackers and the trust I would need to have in a company to not spy on me. So I set out to roll my own. One way or another, I've had a home server providing some amount of service to my household since 2018 or so. Until now, that solution has always felt hacked together and incomplete. Now, after seven years of casual tinkering, I have a solution that I like enough to rip off the band-aid and cancel several of the various services I've used as a security blanket while I've built my own solution.

## The Hardware

A home server can be anything from a raspberry pi to a huge rack-mounted monstrosity. Mine lies somewhere firmly in the middle between those two extremes. At the end of the day, the minimum requirement is a bit of computation power, and some storage. I fulfilled that with a Ryzon 5 1600 CPU and three 4TB hard drives.
