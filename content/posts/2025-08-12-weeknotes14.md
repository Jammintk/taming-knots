* I'm sorry that your RSS reader may have marked all of my previous posts as Unread. As a part of my preparation for moving TK-Web.top away from GitHub permanently, I am now hosting via Cloudflare Pages. This hasn't completely removed the need for GitHub yet. That's going to be a different step. I will absolutely detail the changes to the site when I make that leap. I know Cloudflare isn't really an incredible company, especially with how much of the internet writ large they have their grubby little paws on, but they aren't Microsoft, who announced this past week that GitHub was no longer going to be run independently from the main business. Microsoft is currently a target for the BDS boycott due to their support for Israel's government, which is perpetrating a genocide against the Palistinian people.
* I know I'm very late with this week's notes. There was a good reason! Migrating the website was part of it, but here's the other part:
* I reinstalled Endeavour OS over the weekend. While I didn't really *need* to reinstall Endeavour, it's a nice opportunity to make the computer a little more friendly to my wife and reclaim 1TB of storage that was previously allocated to a Windows install. On the new install, I'm back to being all in on KDE. I do miss some of the niceties of Hyprland, but part of being able to support my wife's move to Linux is going to be using the same exact setup she is so I know how to help.
* Over at The Worst Community Report, we took over Video Game Podtimism for a week, doing an imitation show. I really enjoyed the recording and editing process. I'm looking forward to the next opportunity we have to ape a network show. It's really fun to completely change format for a week and have something a little looser and free-flowing.
* A little over a week from removing YouTube Shorts from my life and I couldn't be happier. On the web, I'm using SponsorBlock, BlockTube, and the uBlock Origin filter `www.youtube.com##ytd-rich-section-renderer:has([href^="/playables"])` to block Playables, Movies, and Shorts entirely. On my phone, I'm using Youtube ReVanced with settings added that permanently hide shorts, playables, etc. Sorry [Brendon](https://www.youtube.com/@itswavelengths), but your shorts (which are actually good) are going to have to take the L for the greater good. I'm also blocking a large number of AI music channels via [This blocklist](https://surasshu.com/blocklist-for-ai-music-on-youtube/) from Surasshu, loaded into BlockTube on my desktop. I haven't looked to see if I can add the same blocklist into ReVanced yet.
* As a separate note, I'm trialing [This blocklist](https://github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist?tab=readme-ov-file) from Laylavish to block a bunch of other AI bullshit on the web writ large. I haven't been running it long enough yet to know for sure if I'll have problems, but if it doesn't cause any trouble, I'll probably adopt it into my PiHole instance.

## Playing

* We played Gekido Advance for the aforementioned VGP episode. It was a fun time and a game I normally wouldn't play, so I'm glad we did it. IT's hard as shit though, so maybe use some emulator cheats on it.

* I put about a half dozen hours into [Rose & Violet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usWlhxq1704&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fgamebanana.com%2F&source_ve_path=MjM4NTE), a Persona 5 story overhaul putting Kasumi Yoshizawa in the protagonist role. There's some mod-jank in there, but overall I'm finding the experience really charming. It has me excited to experience this story a third time, despite its flaws (which I hope this mod addresses more fully than the Royal version did.)

* I started [Super Mariomon](https://youtu.be/2B1v94Dp1Jw) on lunch today. It's extremely charming, and very very well polished. I'm only a half-hour in, but I'm excited to play more. I haven't been a pokemon person in a while, but maybe a completely new coat of paint will help me enjoy it more.

## Watching

Less longform stuff this week, given my busy busy schedule, but here's some recs.

* [The latest](https://youtu.be/xEEfp8OqgHo) from Charles Cornell. He's a jazz musician who does a fantastic job breaking down all kinds of music. This one is on Ocarina of Time.
* [Greg over at How to Drink](https://youtu.be/R14xkfPpKDA) has been doing many more episodes lately including significant bits of history. I hope the episodes are doing well for him because I love the addition of history to his formula and it's so obvious that he loves the history portion.
* Chris's latest [Antikythera Mechanism](https://youtu.be/xwmxmUNA7Pw) episode on Clickspring is comforting and wonderfully informative as always. I'm excited for him to be able to piece the whole thing together by the end of the series.

## Listening

* It's not often I get to shout out music I've added to my collection. This time, it's [Hard Won](https://lizzieno.bandcamp.com/album/hard-won) by Lizzie No, which I was put on to from a 99% Invisible episode about Centralia, PA which is *still burning* from a fire started in 1962. The track in question is lovely on this album.
* [Hello](https://www.play-asia.com/hello-cd-blu-ray/13/70iml1) by Furui Riho is the opening song for City the Animation and I cannot stop listening to it. I'm a sucker for horns on a song, I guess.
