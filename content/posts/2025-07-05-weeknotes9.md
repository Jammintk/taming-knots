* A short week this week. I worked Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and then only for a couple hours on Thursday thanks to the Fourth of July holiday. It's nice to have a bit of a break.
* We got Sophie some CBD oil to try and curb her anxiety during the fireworks.



## Playing

* Soul Hackers 2. I wrote a play log for SH2 with my initial thoughts. You can find it [here](https://tk-web.top/posts/2025-07-01-playlog-sh2-1/). Overall I'm liking it a fair bit!

## Watching

* Finished the original Star Wars trilogy with my wife. It was fun to revisit, but I think I'm all Star Wars'd out for the time being. Andor will have to wait I think.

* Started and completed Stardust Telepath at Zeno's recommendation. It's a cute little show, but not really striking in any major way. Very much empty calories, but it's a genre I am a sucker for.
