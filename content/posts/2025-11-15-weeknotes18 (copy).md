## Tinkering

* I updated the [Uses](/pages/uses) page. It's now a little longer and more detailed.
* I also updated the [Connections](/pages/connections) page with some of my own projects. Probably not anything new to anyone here, but might be nice to have all in one spot.
* Did the network swap at the new place. Still running into severe signal issues at the new "office" location. I'm going to see if I can use an old AP as a repeater, but initial results suggest not.
* I'm doing some looking into Subtitles options for Jellyfin. The OpenSubtitles plugin straight up doesn't do anything, so I'm looking at bazarr.

## Playing

* Yakuza Kiwami has been taking most of my gaming time this week. I've been doing a *lot* more sub-stories in this game. The Trouble Finder accessory is helping a lot with that. I'm 5 chapters in, and really enjoying it.
* I have *nearly* conquered the Basic Tours in Ridge Racer 2 PSP. The last few races are really putting a damper on my progress. I might have to look at some strategies for them.
* I played the first half hour or so of Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth for the PSP this morning. I like it, but it's very slow. I might swap to emulation just to have a fast forward throttle.

## Watching

* Got up through episode 8 of Twin Peaks the Return this week. I'm having a good time, but the thing is grade A crazy. I am really hoping I get any closure at all, even if I have to pull it from vagaries and assumptions.
* Not started yet, but I'm going to be picking up Mobile Suit Gundam Wing this week, to watch along with Bluzo a bit. I'm looking forward to it!
* I've been watching some of the Game Changer that I hadn't had access to before. I think alongside Taskmaster, it is one of the most interesting game show concepts I've ever seen and I love it a lot.
