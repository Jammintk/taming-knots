description: 'Tools, Programs, and Defaults'

A modern system is a constantly changing and mutating organism. Tools come and go, defaults change, things are in a constant state of flux. This is a periodically updated list of devices, tools, and services I'm using. Items in *italics* are things I'm looking to move away from, if I can find a suitable replacement. Items separated by a pipe (|) are a GUI for a command line tool. GUI is always first. Items separated by commas both do the same job, and I'm either transitioning, or I use different tools depending on the task.
