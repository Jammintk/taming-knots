  <meta property="og:description" content="Weeknotes Returns! It has been a long few months, but I am happy to say my Weeknotes are back! It has been quite the journey since last I wrote, but here’s the short version. As mentioned in the How Taming Knots Works post, Taming Knots is a folder of markdown files that Hugo converts into pretty, static HTML for me. Previously, this was all happening through GitHub Actions and deployed to GitHub Pages. I want to eventually move off of GitHub as much as I possibly can, so I have tried a few different things. I tried moving to Codeberg Pages, I tried to move to Gitea and use their Actions pipeline to deploy to Cloudflare Pages. I even looked at GitLab for a bit. Eventually though, I decided the juice wasn’t worth the squeeze right at this second and that the tinkering was getting in the way of the writing, so I settled everything back down into a setup where I feel like I can move away easily if I need to, but also I can continue to write while I do more research on a better option long term. Taming Knots is still a bunch of markdown files that get uploaded to a Github Repo, but now instead of building and hosting through GitHub, I have Cloudflare Pages watching for changes to the repo and building and deploying the site when it detects a commit. Being on Cloudflare means that I can easily pull the Github piece out and replace it with GitLab if I so choose or I can use any other “Actions” style worker to run Cloudflare’s Wrangler tool to package up and deploy the website from many other code ops platform, including Gitea which may make a comeback eventually. All that to say I basically made a big loop, but now I feel more ready to go on the second journey eventually.">

<p>It has been a long few months, but I am happy to say my Weeknotes are back! It has been quite the journey since last I wrote, but here&rsquo;s the short version. As mentioned in <a href="/posts/2025-05-16-newsite/">the How Taming Knots Works</a> post, Taming Knots is a folder of markdown files that <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> converts into pretty, static HTML for me. Previously, this was all happening through GitHub Actions and deployed to GitHub Pages. I want to eventually move off of GitHub as much as I possibly can, so I have tried a few different things. I tried moving to <a href="https://docs.codeberg.org/codeberg-pages/">Codeberg Pages</a>, I tried to move to <a href="https://about.gitea.com/">Gitea</a> and use their Actions pipeline to deploy to <a href="https://pages.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Pages</a>. I even looked at GitLab for a bit. Eventually though, I decided the juice wasn&rsquo;t worth the squeeze right at this second and that the tinkering was getting in the way of the writing, so I settled everything back down into a setup where I feel like I can move away easily if I need to, but also I can continue to write while I do more research on a better option long term. Taming Knots is still a bunch of markdown files that get uploaded to a Github Repo, but now instead of building and hosting through GitHub, I have Cloudflare Pages watching for changes to the repo and building and deploying the site when it detects a commit. Being on Cloudflare means that I can easily pull the Github piece out and replace it with GitLab if I so choose or I can use any other &ldquo;Actions&rdquo; style worker to run Cloudflare&rsquo;s Wrangler tool to package up and deploy the website from many other code ops platform, including Gitea which may make a comeback eventually. All that to say I basically made a big loop, but now I feel more ready to go on the second journey eventually.</p>
<h2 id="moving">Moving!</h2>
<p>Another reason my weeknotes have lapsed is that I&rsquo;m moving! We are selling the house out in the boonies and moving to a much more affordable place for the next year or two. As you can imagine, packing up the entire house and getting it ready for sale is taking up a lot of my time. Thankfully, this stress will be significantly lessened soon, so my weeknotes and other writing can resume.</p>
<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve finally gotten my home server into a spot I&rsquo;m really happy with. I hope it&rsquo;s easy for me to quickly set back up post-move. I&rsquo;ve set everything up to be fairly portable. You can read more about it <a href="/posts/2025-10-30-the-home-server/">In my Home Server post</a>.</p>
<h2 id="playing">Playing</h2>
<ul>
<li>Alan Wake II - I&rsquo;ve been really enjoying this one. I love the wide variety in tones that are clearly separated by the characters. Having one character working with a more unsteady and often silly tone while the other does very serious, intense investigation is a fantastic combination.</li>
<li>Easy Delivery Co. - When I don&rsquo;t have the brain power for Alan Wake, I&rsquo;ve been playing this fun winter delivery game. It&rsquo;s got fun physics and definitely fits into the &ldquo;drive a shitty car&rdquo; genre of vehicle games that I enjoy so very much.</li>
<li>Ridge Racer 2 - A game for when I truly do not want to have to use brain at all. Cars go fast. Do cool drifts. My PSP is so pretty.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
<ul>
<li>Still working my way through <em>House of Leaves</em> by Mark Z Danielewski. I&rsquo;d estimate I&rsquo;m about a third of the way through it. It&rsquo;s tough to tell becuase there&rsquo;s a lot of flipping back and forth.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="watching">Watching</h2>
<ul>
<li>Twin Peaks - Emily and I have finished the first two seasons and the movie. We talked about it <a href="https://twcr-radio.online/episodes/sexual-maturity-combined-with-superhuman-strength-makes-mike-a-sub">On the podcast</a> for a few hours. I&rsquo;m excited to get back to it and watch The Return.</li>
<li>City the Animation - Still plucking away at this. It&rsquo;s extremely good, I just haven&rsquo;t gotten to it as often as I&rsquo;d like.</li>
</ul>
