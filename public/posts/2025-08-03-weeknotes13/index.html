  <meta property="og:description" content="A second rough week in a row. A debilitating migraine Thursday and a very late night Wednesday combined with a nice shouting match earlier in the week to really put a damper on things. I’m doing better now that it’s the weekend. We did some yard work to fix up the front of the house yesterday. Planted some new shrubs and added a border ring to one of the trees. Probably going to do the other tree today after I mow. I’m looking forward to getting it done. The shrubs especially have looked bad for an entire year. I finally decided to ditch Nextcloud on the home server. It offered a lot of nice features, but it ran super slowly and was too heavy. I don’t need enterprise features in a personal file server. So instead, I’ve deployed Copyparty, which is a file server written in python and deployable in Docker. I haven’t set everything up I want to with it, but I’ve got the basics working and I really like it so far. It does exactly what I need: provide access to my home server’s file storage from anywhere. The next step for the home server is deploying a photo management solution that plays nice with Copyparty. I’ve set up my RG35XXSP again with MuOS Pixie. I’m going to start playing more games at work on my breaks. I love this little thing and the newest version of MuOS feels really great to use. I’ve decided that my experiment with Hyprland is at an end. As much as I like it, I also want my PC to be as approachable as possible for Emily, so I’m going to switch back to Plasma. This is going to come with a complete reinstall of the OS to clean things up a bit. I’m looking forward to finally excising Windows from my personal life and switching full time back to Plasma is the best way to do that I think. Playing More Robotnik’s Ring Racers. I’m just about done with all of the cups in single player on the basic difficulty. There’s a lot there within the base release not counting the community made tracks. I haven’t even really looked at additional tracks for the game yet, but I’m excited to jump in with those eventually. I played a bunch of the Worst Game Jam 3 submissions Ghost &amp; Found and Along an Etremety were big hits for me. I highly recommend you check them out! Watching We’re still plugging away at DanDaDan Season 2 and City the Animation. We’re enjoying both of them quite a lot. Once these are done, we’ll probably return to Twin Peaks.">
