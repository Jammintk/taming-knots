  <meta property="og:description" content="Tinkering I updated the Uses page. It’s now a little longer and more detailed. I also updated the Connections page with some of my own projects. Probably not anything new to anyone here, but might be nice to have all in one spot. Did the network swap at the new place. Still running into severe signal issues at the new “office” location. I’m going to see if I can use an old AP as a repeater, but initial results suggest not. I’m doing some looking into Subtitles options for Jellyfin. The OpenSubtitles plugin straight up doesn’t do anything, so I’m looking at bazarr. Playing Yakuza Kiwami has been taking most of my gaming time this week. I’ve been doing a lot more sub-stories in this game. The Trouble Finder accessory is helping a lot with that. I’m 5 chapters in, and really enjoying it. I have nearly conquered the Basic Tours in Ridge Racer 2 PSP. The last few races are really putting a damper on my progress. I might have to look at some strategies for them. I played the first half hour or so of Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth for the PSP this morning. I like it, but it’s very slow. I might swap to emulation just to have a fast forward throttle. Watching Got up through episode 8 of Twin Peaks the Return this week. I’m having a good time, but the thing is grade A crazy. I am really hoping I get any closure at all, even if I have to pull it from vagaries and assumptions. Not started yet, but I’m going to be picking up Mobile Suit Gundam Wing this week, to watch along with Bluzo a bit. I’m looking forward to it! I’ve been watching some of the Game Changer that I hadn’t had access to before. I think alongside Taskmaster, it is one of the most interesting game show concepts I’ve ever seen and I love it a lot.">
