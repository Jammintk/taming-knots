  <meta property="og:description" content="Really feeling the drag at work because I’m so short on days left before switching jobs. As of the posting of this, I’ve only got two days left. I feel like I haven’t changed my demeanor much toward my coworkers, but they interpret every joke I make as much more bold than I normally would be and attribute that to me leaving. Maybe they’re right. I did a lot more writing this week than I expected to. A double header on Monday, the week notes of course, and some drafts in the works too. I feel like I’ll swing between heavier and lighter weeks a bit, but I am really enjoying getting to write again. I tried setting up Rusty Music Player Client and the daemon it connects to, but I didn’t really love the experience. I just think some apps shouldn’t be so complicated and a terminal ui just doesn’t work for how I’d use a music player anyway. I think I’ll stick to Strawberry and Tauon. I worked on a REDACTED project this week with REDACTED and REDACTED. We even had REDACTED help us out as REDACTED. I’m really excited to REDACTED on REDACTED. Did a TON of cleaning up in the yard and garden this morning. Helped Emily move a big Mile High Iris that was falling over, pulled a bajillion weeds, picked up after the dog, and cleaned out the garage. I have to mow tomorrow which i’m dreading. It’s been raining enough that I haven’t been able to mow for three weeks. The yard is a jungle. The clover is coming in nicely though! Playing Dipping in slightly to Dark Cloud 2 again. Mostly just due to not really feeling the pull to start anything new that’s on the larger side. I probably won’t play a whole lot more of it this time.">

<li>Really feeling the drag at work because I&rsquo;m so short on days left before switching jobs. As of the posting of this, I&rsquo;ve only got two days left. I feel like I haven&rsquo;t changed my demeanor much toward my coworkers, but they interpret every joke I make as much more bold than I normally would be and attribute that to me leaving. Maybe they&rsquo;re right.</li>
<li>I did a lot more writing this week than I expected to. A double header on Monday, the week notes of course, and some drafts in the works too. I feel like I&rsquo;ll swing between heavier and lighter weeks a bit, but I am really enjoying getting to write again.</li>
<li>I tried setting up <a href="https://mierak.github.io/rmpc/">Rusty Music Player Client</a> and the daemon it connects to, but I didn&rsquo;t really love the experience. I just think some apps shouldn&rsquo;t be so complicated and a terminal ui just doesn&rsquo;t work for how I&rsquo;d use a music player anyway. I think I&rsquo;ll stick to <a href="https://www.strawberrymusicplayer.org/">Strawberry</a> and <a href="https://tauonmusicbox.rocks/">Tauon</a>.</li>
<li>I worked on a <strong>REDACTED</strong> project this week with <strong>REDACTED</strong> and <strong>REDACTED</strong>. We even had <strong>REDACTED</strong> help us out as <strong>REDACTED</strong>. I&rsquo;m really excited to <strong>REDACTED</strong> on <strong>REDACTED</strong>.</li>
<li>Did a <em>TON</em> of cleaning up in the yard and garden this morning. Helped Emily move a big Mile High Iris that was falling over, pulled a bajillion weeds, picked up after the dog, and cleaned out the garage. I have to mow tomorrow which i&rsquo;m dreading. It&rsquo;s been raining enough that I haven&rsquo;t been able to mow for three weeks. The yard is a jungle. The clover is coming in nicely though!</li>

<li>
<p>Dipping in slightly to Dark Cloud 2 again. Mostly just due to not really feeling the pull to start anything new that&rsquo;s on the larger side. I probably won&rsquo;t play a whole lot more of it this time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Picked up Cyberpunk 2077 again, hoping to finish the DLC then go back in to the main story and finish that. I&rsquo;ve done so much side stuff that there can&rsquo;t be <em>that</em> much game left.</p>

This week&rsquo;s episode on Blue Prince has me wanting to dig back in to the game and unlock more of the deep mysteries, though I&rsquo;ll probably bounce right away anyway.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="reading">Reading:</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://joelchrono.xyz/blog/new-desk-and-keyboard/">Joel got a new desk</a> and has joined the ranks of the mechanical keyboard typists. I really like the color scheme of his keys. The post somewhat inspired my Tech Loadout post from Monday.</li>
<li>I stumbled into the <a href="https://shellsharks.com/scrolls/scroll/2025-05-16">Scrolls</a> blog and really love it. Basically just a shotgun blast of indie web and fediverse stuff to look at in each issue. The next issue is a bit late. I really hope it continues.</li>
<li>Sophy Wong has started a <a href="https://sophywong.com/studionotes/2025/5/13/just-start">Studio Notes</a> blog. I love this post on some strategies to just start making something. I find myself doing the same things fairly often.</li>
<li>Brendon is in Japan and has posted a <a href="https://wavelengths.online/posts/the-home-screen-in-japan-may-2025">home screen update</a> from the trip. I love these kinds of posts, even if I&rsquo;m not a fan of the iOS look.  Now I have to wait for a bit to post mine though so it doesn&rsquo;t look like I&rsquo;m piling on.</li>
<li>Adam over at <a href="https://omg.lol">omg.lol</a> made a post about their new venture, a <a href="https://notes.neatnik.net/2025/05/seizing-the-means-of-discovery">web directory for their members</a>. I&rsquo;m glad that the directory is viewable by non-members. It will join <a href="https://ooh.directory">Ooh Directory</a> in places I visit periodically to find new blogs to follow.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="videos">Videos:</h3>
<ul>
<li>I stumbled upon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BreadOnPenguins">Bread on Penguins</a> recently. I like how quickly and without fanfare she digs into each topic. I probably won&rsquo;t use everything she features, but I&rsquo;ve picked up a few settings and tools from her videos that I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll use a lot.</li>
