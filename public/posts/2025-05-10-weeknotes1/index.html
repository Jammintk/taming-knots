  <meta property="og:description" content="I want to get into the habit of writing more often. Weeknotes seems like a good way to hone the skill a bit and reflect on prior weeks as I do.
I did an extra day of work this week, my overtime clocked in at around 9 hours for the pay period. My notes are probably going to be really light because of it. I did twelve job applications. I got emails to set up interviews on two of my previous applications from last week or the week before. I also got a call on one, but the pay was too low. My wife and I have continued to plug along in Twin Peaks. We’re almost done with the first season. I’m surprised she’s liking it as much as she is. I hope the remainder of the show doesn’t leave her cold. I wrote two blog posts last week in my “Embracing Open Source” series. These were mostly background. I’m looking forward to the second “part” of the series where I go into detail about my setup and experiences with Linux as a daily driver OS and Hyprland as my most recent desktop environment love. I didn’t do much gaming this week. I mostly just came home and slept after work. I did check out the demo for BloodThief though and it seems like a really fantastic speed game. It will be interesting to see how much the developer leans in to it. So far it seems like a lot. I’ve been futzing with my RSS reader setup a lot these past few days, trying to find good blogs to subscribe to. Today I got RSS Hub set up to compliment my existing FreshRSS install. Now, I can use RSS Hub to dig up and generate RSS feeds for more stuff on the internet. Tonight is Chinese food and digging into Twig’s Adventure 64, a game by a developer I really like that specializes in little collectathon platformers.">
