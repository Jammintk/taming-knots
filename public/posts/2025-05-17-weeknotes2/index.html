<p>Got off of my six-day workweek last week and dove straight into a day and a half of cleaning the house and getting the yard back into shape. I was dead tired after, but this week has been more-ish relaxing, thankfully.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I got a wonderful email from a reader and fellow blogger (Check out <a href="https://joelchrono.xyz/">Joel’s blog here</a>.) I’m sure he would say it isn’t much, but I do really appreciate the contact. It’s amazing how much motivation just one message gave me to keep going. We&rsquo;ve since been carrying on a longer conversation back and forth. I hope I can forge similar friendships with other bloggers around both the Worst Garbage Online community and in the wider &rsquo;net as a whole.</p>

<p>I had three interviews this week. The first was with a law firm. I think I did well on it. The second was with a Managed Service Provider over the phone. I must have done well with it because they wanted to schedule a video interview the very next day. That video interview was the third one. The same company that wanted a video interview right away reached out <em>again</em> and I&rsquo;m now going in to the office to speak to them in person Monday. I had a fourth interview scheduled for a penetration testing company, but the rep dropped out last minute. I guess a meeting went over time. Hopefully we can re-connect sometime next week.</p>

<p>Taming Knots has a new home! I love Pika.page, but I was interested in seeing what self-hosting a site would look like. Then I realized site hosting and email hosting are <em>the</em> two things I really don&rsquo;t want to do on my home server because they&rsquo;re annoying to set up and my ISP probably won&rsquo;t like me hosting on my personal connection. I opted for using Hugo with GitHub Pages instead. I don&rsquo;t love hosting it on GitHub, which is owned by Microsoft, but the documentation is just so much better when working with GitHub, so I&rsquo;m kind of stuck. The nice thing is that storage space is not really a concern, especially given how light Hugo&rsquo;s sites are and as long as I stay under 30,000 files, I won&rsquo;t draw the ire of GitHub, so for now on a technical level, it&rsquo;s the perfect host for my little project, especially since the hosting is free.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve set up local mail clients both on my PC and on my phone. In addition, I&rsquo;ve started using PGP encryption on email. I am still using Gmail, but I&rsquo;d like to eventually move away from the service along with most other Google stuff. I know using encryption for something like Email makes me seem a bit like a crank, but to be honest it&rsquo;s boilerplate privacy tech. I&rsquo;ll probably go over PGP basics in a future <a href="/content/posts/2025-05-15-EOS3">Embracing Open Source</a> post, but for now if you want my pub key, just ask!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m back on my bullshit again, playing Dark Cloud 2. It&rsquo;s like a comfy warm blanket of a game to me at this point. I normally am very much against upscaled texture packs for old games, but I figured I&rsquo;d try it this time just to see. So far, everything looks pretty great except for the inventory icons, which are still jagged and low resolution. There&rsquo;s probably just not enough detail there for an algorithm to upscale them while still looking nice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My wife and I finished Season 1 of Twin Peaks, so now we&rsquo;re on to Season 2. I&rsquo;m fully in new stuff I&rsquo;ve never seen before, so I&rsquo;m excited to go through it.</p>
