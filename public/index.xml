      <title>Play Log: Soul Hackers 2</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been lamenting the fact that I don&amp;rsquo;t have good notes for games that I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing, which means when I share a game on The Worst Community Report, I end up unable to properly articulate my thoughts. I&amp;rsquo;m sure the more I talk about things, the more I will feel confident as I speak critically. However, in an effort to speed up this process and flex my critic&amp;rsquo;s muscle, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to start writing play logs for myself and publishing them. Not every game will get a log, and they may not always be in a nice, easy to read format. They may not even make sense outside of the context of my own brain. I do hope they are useful or enjoyable somewhat, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soul Hackers 2 is a JRPG from Atlus released in 2022. I&amp;rsquo;m playing it on PC. Soul Hackers as a series is a sequel to the 1997 Devil Summoner: Soul Hackers for the Sega Saturn, which got updated ports for PSX and 3DS later on. I always misremember the original Soul Hackers as a GBA game. Soul Hackers is technically a sequel to the original Devil Summoner from 1995, though the Devil Summoner series splits into Soul Hackers, which is the JRPG style branch and the Raidou games, which are the action combat version. Raidou&amp;rsquo;s first game recently got a remaster for modern platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started Soul Hackers 2 about a week and a half ago. I picked it up mostly because it was reasonably cheap and because it was SMT-related, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d like whatever Push Turn varient it was sporting. I&amp;rsquo;ve never played any of the other Devil Summoner games extensively, so this series is more or less new to me, though I do really like Persona, another SMT spinoff. Since I started, I&amp;rsquo;ve played maybe six hours or so. Not enought to truly dig in yet, but enough to be introduced to much of the main cast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the characters. I enjoy the cast a fair bit. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a great idea of how Saizo and Arrow are going to be long term, but I do really enjoy Milady, Figue, and especially Ringo. The protagonists of the Persona games do have some personality, especially if you read and carefully consider your dialogue choices, but Ringo contrasts signficantly with the Persona MCs. She has a lot more personality straight from the jump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I find really interesting about the characters and the story is that Figue and Ringo, the two AI leads are specifically not robots, but they aren&amp;rsquo;t completely human either. That said, Aion, the system that birthed them, decided that beings with souls were what was needed most to ensure the success of their mission. A purely logical being wouldn&amp;rsquo;t perform the Soul Hacks Ringo does to restore the other characters to life. Ringo&amp;rsquo;s curiosity and sense of humor help me stay attached to her a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanics are both simpler and more complex than Persona. Gone is Push Turn, replaced by a standard battle system, and the number of damage types is also reduced. That said, the Sabbath system that replaces Push Turn and weakness exploitation feels great to use and does a lot of similar things to Push Turn, where you are encouraged to exploit weaknesses, but spread the damage out among the various enemies in each encounter. The COMP and Soul Skill systems give each character a sense of a build even though they all have the ability to use any Demon you like (as long as there are no duplicates)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship building feels lighter than Persona, but it also feels less missable. The skills you get from the relationships also seem very  very very good, so I&amp;rsquo;ll be interested to see how they shake out. I love when a game gives you broken abilities on purpose and this seems to be aligned in the same direction.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Switching to an ergo-split keyboard</title>
      <link>/posts/2025-07-01-kboard/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/posts/2025-07-01-kboard/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My old keyboard has been dying for months, maybe a year, even. It&amp;rsquo;s a Logitech G815. The thing that has been the most annoying as it has aged has been the volume roller registering phantom input and not registering intended input. Some of the keys started to get unreliable as well, so I decided it was time to retire it. My new job has me typing a lot more, so I wanted to try something new. Maybe I could stave off some of my RSI symptoms if I got something more ergonomic. After several months of doing research, I decided it was finally time to pull the trigger, so I bought a split ergonomic keyboard in the form of a Lily58 kit from &lt;a href=&#34;https://typeractive.xyz&#34;&gt;Typeractive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;picking-the-lily58&#34;&gt;Picking the Lily58&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In looking at what would theoretically feel better on my wrists where my RSI is most present, I found that there are several factors when it comes to creating a good typing position. One of the biggest things you can do immediately is separate your hands and keep your arms as straight as possible, with appropriate bends at the elbows. On a normal keyboard, this isn&amp;rsquo;t really possible, but if you chop the board in half, you can adjust to any width you like. Another ergonomic adjustment that isn&amp;rsquo;t really possible on a standard board is adjusting the angle. Not front to back, like most keyboards allow for, but from side to side. It&amp;rsquo;s advantageous to type on an angled board, with the thumb side of your hand higher than the pinky side. Many split keyboards have options for tenting feet that let you make that adjustment. The Lily58 fits both of these criteria, while also having enough keys to fit my preference. Many ergonomic split keybaords very few keys, which makes the emulation of a full layout difficult. The Lily58 has 58 keys, so with very basic layering, every function is available. I also wanted to stay away from some of the more expensive options. Like many hobbies, it feels like you can spend as much as you want on a keybaord these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This keyboard might come off looking pretty DIY and it is. The actual layout is open source (MIT License) and was designed by &lt;a href=&#34;http://kata0510.github.io/Lily58-Document/&#34;&gt;Kata0518 on Github&lt;/a&gt;, but you can buy the boards from a variety of sellers. Most places that sell the Lily58 simply print the circuit board for it and sell that. Maybe with the other components needed to make it function, but they often don&amp;rsquo;t assemble the boards at all. Typeractive offers a half-built option. They do the difficult and tedious soldering of the diodes and hotswap switch sockets and you solder the much easier controllers and displays. The key switches and keycaps themselves are all press-in. This was the biggest reason I went with them. The other major reason is that they have a customized Lily58 option that uses Kailh Choc key switches, which are lower profile than the standard Cherry MX style switches you may know well from most mechanical keyboards. The lower profile switches tend to fell better to me. My old keyboard used Logitech Romer-G switches, which felt like low profile Kailh switches anyway, so the sound and feel of my new keyboard feels familiar in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;building-the-board&#34;&gt;Building the Board&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board came in several parts. In the box, I got the PCBs, top plates, 3D printed cases, sixty Kailh Choc white switches, a set of MBK Hypersonic keycaps, a pair of Nice!Nano controllers, a pair of batteries, a pair of Nice!View screens, a set of four tenting feet, and a pair of acrylic screen covers, as well as the hardware required to get it all together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process for building the board went pretty easily. I&amp;rsquo;d never soldered pins like these before, but once I got the hang of it, all the joints went together well. It&amp;rsquo;s always fun for me to learn a new skill, and now I&amp;rsquo;m itching to do more projects like this. After everything was soldered, it was a simple matter of pressing in the switches and screwing the case together. In the end it took me a couple hours across two days, but I&amp;rsquo;m very happy with the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nice!Nano modules use ZMK firmware, which is an open source standard. I don&amp;rsquo;t really have a horse in the race between QMK/ZMK, but working with ZMK was super easy. I used the online &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nickcoutsos/keymap-editor&#34;&gt;keymap editor&lt;/a&gt; made by Nick Coutsos to generate it. My layout is fairly simple. I have most things available on the &lt;a href=&#34;/baselayer.png&#34;&gt;base&lt;/a&gt; layer, with a numpad, arrow keys, media keys, bluetooth settings, and function row available on the &lt;a href=&#34;/raiselayer.png&#34;&gt;raise&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&#34;lowerlayer.png&#34;&gt;lower&lt;/a&gt; layers. I&amp;rsquo;m not completely happy with it. Having the esc key in the number row isn&amp;rsquo;t great. My muscle memory is always off by one key in that row. I think it&amp;rsquo;s not the best layout, but I like it so far otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/lily58.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;adapting&#34;&gt;Adapting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting used to the Lily58 has been a challenge. It has really illuminated some bad typing habits. I don&amp;rsquo;t use my pinky fingers as much as I probably should and I move my hands across the board a lot. These habits are bad, ergonomically, but have been very difficult for me to kick. I still mistype more often on the 58 than on my work laptop or standard keyboard and I&amp;rsquo;m slower there too. I have been improving though, and now I catch myself sometimes typing for several seconds at a time without looking down or stumbling. I&amp;rsquo;m sure that as I type more, I will keep getting better and I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Weeknotes #8</title>
      <link>/posts/2025-06-28-weeknotes8/</link>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I&amp;rsquo;m getting the hang of Reaper. This week&amp;rsquo;s Worst Community Report was finished well before deadline this time. I still spent longer than I&amp;rsquo;d like to on it, but with some practice, it should keep getting better and better!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had another one on one meeting with my new boss. Well, new as of around a month ago anyway. We talked a little about my performance. He complimented my gung ho attitude in wanting to dive straight into the work. I told him it&amp;rsquo;s the best way for me to learn. Most of the rest of the meeting was talking about office culture and how unique our position is as contracted employees &amp;ldquo;working for&amp;rdquo; a service provider but embedded with the client. Overall, I&amp;rsquo;m really enjoying the new job. It feels much more interesting and fun than wrenching on wheelchairs and I feel like there&amp;rsquo;s a lot for me to look forward to learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhat related to my new job, I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting more prone to headaches. I feel like it&amp;rsquo;s probably from the increased screen time. I&amp;rsquo;ll increase the strength on the blue filter on them and turn the brightness down a touch. I had the screens bright and higher contrast because I hadn&amp;rsquo;t dialed in window scaling for my eyesight. Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve started working with bigger fonts, I&amp;rsquo;m going to start working on comfort. Maybe since my glasses will be less prone to damage now, I should get some new ones with an anti-glare coating. That said, I have never really noticed or been bothered by glare on my lenses, so it might be a waste. Maybe something I try once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of getting used to things, though, I am getting better and better at typing on my Lily58. The quibbles I have with the layout still bug me, but overall, I do like it. I wonder if the ergonomic benefits are actually helping or not. Now that I no longer turn wrenches for a living, my RSI pain is less intense most days anyway, so it&amp;rsquo;s tough to tell if the keyboard is actually helping or not. The one thing I don&amp;rsquo;t like about it is the very small battery in each half. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty simple to upgrade and it&amp;rsquo;s not a HUGE deal if it&amp;rsquo;s small, but I would still like to have it be a bit better. Right now it&amp;rsquo;s good for a couple days at the most, a far cry from the Logitech keyboards that can run for a year on a couple AA batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m thinking I want to get in the market for a cheap used laptop to put Linux on. It sounds like some of the nicer Chromebooks would be a really good pick for it, since the OS kills consumer interest in them. A laptop that would be $400 with Windows can be had for less than a hundred bucks. That said, this is a project that will have to wait a bit. I have a lot of other project irons in the fire, so to speak. This will have to wait unless I see a really great deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I put in my notes last week, I want to start reading more, so yesterday I set up Calibre on my home server. I&amp;rsquo;m planning on starting with a few of the books &lt;a href=&#34;https://joelchrono.xyz/blog/the-big-time/&#34;&gt;Joel&lt;/a&gt; has been &lt;a href=&#34;https://joelchrono.xyz/blog/the-space-merchants/&#34;&gt;reading&lt;/a&gt; lately. From his reviews and talking to him, I feel like I&amp;rsquo;d enjoy them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;playing&#34;&gt;Playing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I picked up Soul Hackers 2, the sequel to the spinoff of the spinoff of Shin Megami Tensei. First impression is pretty good. It has an interesting way of encouraging you to not focus down enemies one at a time, which is a staple of FF/DQ JRPGs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;watching&#34;&gt;Watching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife and I have been watching the original Star Wars trilogy. It&amp;rsquo;s fun to go back to those movies, even if the readily available versions have some really awful &amp;ldquo;improvements.&amp;rdquo; To be frank, I&amp;rsquo;m surprised Disney doesn&amp;rsquo;t list the original theatrical versions on their streaming service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched all of Apocalypse Hotel in preparation for the Community Report we recorded this morning. It&amp;rsquo;s a fantastic show for lovers of little guys. A fantastic rec from Emily and Zeno.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another week another set of late notes. Between the new job, the podcast, and everything else going on, I&amp;rsquo;m stretched a little thin. Thankfully, I&amp;rsquo;m getting better at editing the podcast quickly and the weekend plans are starting to let up, so I can look forward to some more time soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m getting faster on the Lily58 with some practice. I&amp;rsquo;m not completely used to it yet, but I&amp;rsquo;m improving, which feels nice. I feel like my dream keyboard would be close to this, but with a few more keys. Maybe just one, actually. The esc key needing to be in the same row as the numbers causes a fair few problems, but I also don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;d want to give up a dedicated esc key. Decisions decisions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe we&amp;rsquo;re almost a full month into the Worst Community Report already. I&amp;rsquo;m having a ton of fun with it and I think this week&amp;rsquo;s episode is going to be a banger!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My new job is going well. I am being praised for the speed with which I pick things up, which feels nice. I&amp;rsquo;m thinking I won&amp;rsquo;t have any trouble with the work. My one big anxiety is trying to remember all of the names and locations of the users. I hope that knowledge will come with time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been crazy hot the last few days. Summer is well and truly here. I passed on doing yardwork this weekend. It&amp;rsquo;s just too hot. Hopefully next weekend is a little cooler so I can get some things done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;playing&#34;&gt;Playing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I played and finished Metal Gear Rising Revengeance for this month&amp;rsquo;s Low Key Video Game Book Club. It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting game. It feels very Platiunym, but limited by the Stealth Espionage Action of Metal Gear and Kojima&amp;rsquo;s works. Thankfully I think the Metal Gear of it all re: alerts and stealth can be largely ignored.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My next game is probably going to be completing Cyberpunk 2077. I have a lot of progress and I just need something to fill time until I get to the next game I know I&amp;rsquo;m playing for the Community Report.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;watching&#34;&gt;Watching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My wife and I continue our journey through Twin Peaks. We just discovered who killed Laura Palmer with a large amount of time left in the series, so I&amp;rsquo;m very interested to see where it goes from here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I picked up Apocalypse Hotel on Emily and Zeno&amp;rsquo;s recommendation. I love it so far! It&amp;rsquo;s very cute and funny. I&amp;rsquo;m really interested in seeing where it goes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another light week thanks to the new job, and a busy weekend left me writing these notes a bit late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing to learn and enjoy the Lily58. There&amp;rsquo;s still some things that are tough to remember about the layout, but I&amp;rsquo;m getting faster at typing on it. I did realize that I messed up the placement and orientation of a couple of the tenting feet, so now I need to peel them off and put them on in a better spot, though the smoothness of the keycaps makes me not want to use it tented in the first place. Maybe something to learn over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recorded and released episode 2 of the Community Report this week. Community reception continues to be pretty good. I&amp;rsquo;m getting faster at the edit as well, though I neglected to complete it this weekend as planned. Looks like another week of focusing hard on the edit after work for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Father&amp;rsquo;s day was this weekend. We had my parents, my brother, and his husband over for brunch. It went pretty well. Fairly uneventful, but still nice to spend time together&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;playing&#34;&gt;Playing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cast n Chill demo - A nice idle/casual fishing game with some of the prettiest pixel landscape art I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen. I don&amp;rsquo;t love the fishing mechanics, but the idle mode helps a lot with that. Plus it has a cute dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal Gear Rising Revengeance - Started and finished this one this week. It was the lion&amp;rsquo;s share of my gaming time. I enjoyed it quite a bit, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;d like to go back to it like I do with other Platinum Games titles. It felt kind of like two things glued together, not mixed together if that makes sense. Platinum combat and Kojima weirdness, but the two never really meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ball X Pit demo - From everything I&amp;rsquo;ve seen from Next Fest, I think this is the roguelike to watch. Very polished with a fresh and interesting set of mechanics. Might not dethrone Balatro for me, but I&amp;rsquo;ll be interested in playing the full release for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloodrush: Undying Wish demo - Another roguelike in a sea of them. It has some interesting ideas, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel quite polished enough for me to stick to it long term. Definitely feels like the kind of game that the developer wants you to complete though. Still, it&amp;rsquo;s very mush still in development, so it might get a good amount of tuning before release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;watching&#34;&gt;Watching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly - Probably my absolute favorite western, and a long one too. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen it more times than I can count thanks to my dad. Some incredible directing and performances here. If you like the genre but have never seen it, I highly recommend it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reading&#34;&gt;Reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I shamefully haven&amp;rsquo;t been reading as much as I want to. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a bit of a rough week. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to maybe building or finding a cheap eink ereader to start going through more books, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t done a ton of looking yet.z&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We launched The Worst Community Report this week! The first episode is available on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zV7Jwl6E6Rw&#34;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; and most major podcast platforms. This is a project that came together rapidly, but I&amp;rsquo;m still very proud of what we&amp;rsquo;ve done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m learning Reaper in order to edit the show. It&amp;rsquo;s really complex, but I greatly enjoy using it and look forward to making the show sound better and better!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I built a Lily58 from Typeractive.xyz. It&amp;rsquo;s a split format keyboard intended to be more ergonomic. I&amp;rsquo;m writing these notes with it and am trying to force myself to really learn how to use it quickly. My typing speed is heavily handicapped by the board currently, but I can feel myself learning it. It&amp;rsquo;s strange to learn this and realize that I hardly use my pinkies to type, vastly preferring to slide my hands sideways to use my ring fingers. A post will be incoming as I learn the layout and decide if I like it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I started my new job! I had headaches after the first two days, but I think drinking more water will help. I may have to investigate if I can set up my own tea station. Their beverage game is &lt;em&gt;weak&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;playing&#34;&gt;Playing:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I started Haste: Broken Worlds yesterday. The characters are neat, and the mechanics are pretty solid. It&amp;rsquo;s kind of a roguelike 3D platformer. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty good. Feels kind of B-game-ey in a good way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;listening&#34;&gt;Listening&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nothing particularly new here, but &lt;a href=&#34;https://friendsatthetable.net&#34;&gt;Perpetua&lt;/a&gt; continues to be really good with extremely Final Fantasy IX vibes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reading&#34;&gt;Reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I honestly haven&amp;rsquo;t read as much as I&amp;rsquo;d like to this week. I&amp;rsquo;m thinking I want to set up Calibre or AudioBook Shelf or something and start reading more books again,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;videos&#34;&gt;Videos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stephen posted a new &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/DLsZB0TNSfY&#34;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; on Ace Attorney that is really great. I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to get into more visual novels. Maybe Ace Attorney will be a good way in for me.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Embracing Open Source Part 4: Daily Programs</title>
      <link>/posts/2025-06-01-eos4/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/posts/2025-06-01-eos4/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post is a part of my Embracing Open Source series. You can read the last post&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;/posts/2025-05-15-eos3/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, or if you are particularly interested in a related topic or want to get in touch with me about the series, please&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;/pages/contact/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;send me a message&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post marks the change from general advice and helping new users into Linux toward posts where I&amp;rsquo;ll be explaining things that I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing and what benefit those processes or programs give me, what I would have been using on Windows, and what I wish were different about what I use in the hope that maybe someone reading has a good alternative that does what I need. I particularly don&amp;rsquo;t want to overwhelm with options, so for each type of thing, I&amp;rsquo;ll just mention what I use and move on. If you want something different, you are welcome to do more research on your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common stumbling block for people moving to Linux is wondering what software they&amp;rsquo;ll use on a day-to-day basis. Thankfully, through WINE, Proton, and good old fashioned multi-platform applications, a lot is available to fill the gaps left by another operating system. This post is a quick list of programs that I use daily. They may not be the best in their respective category, but I&amp;rsquo;ve found that for the most part, these get the thing done relatively well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;operating-system-functions&#34;&gt;Operating System Functions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are things that would just be included by default in another operating system, and for which each distribution tends to have a preferred default. Some of these are default to Endeavor OS with KDE Plasma, but many are alternatives that I&amp;rsquo;ve put together after finding some issue with the Plasma default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;File Browser - While &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Thunar&#34;&gt;Thunar&lt;/a&gt; isn&amp;rsquo;t my preferred file browser UI, it is the one that I have ended up with due to some weird compatibility issues between non-KDE desktops and &lt;a href=&#34;https://apps.kde.org/dolphin/&#34;&gt;Dolphin&lt;/a&gt;. If you&amp;rsquo;re on plasma, use Dolphin. It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;exceptionally&lt;/em&gt; good. Tabs, split view, tree view, built in share support, customization context menu entries via Dolphin Actions. On KDE, all of this works fantastically and seamlessly. On other desktops, like Hyprland which is what I use, Dolphin has no idea how to open any files and will not populate a list of applications to use even if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a file association. So I&amp;rsquo;m stuck with Thunar, which is my closest second choice. It has a reasonably good UI, support for a split view and tabs, and with some plugins can even do basic stuff Dolphin handled seamlessly, like using trash folders and generating thumbnails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web Browser - &lt;a href=&#34;https://firefox.com&#34;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; is no longer a &lt;a href=&#34;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/firefox-deletes-promise-to-never-sell-personal-data-asks-users-not-to-panic/&#34;&gt;perfect recommendation&lt;/a&gt;, but I feel like it&amp;rsquo;s still better as a browser to recommend for user privacy than Google Chrome. Firefox is often the default browser option on Linux distributions, though privacy focused alternatives, like &lt;a href=&#34;https://librewolf.net/&#34;&gt;LibreWolf&lt;/a&gt; do exist that are based on the Firefox open source base. I&amp;rsquo;m looking to hopefully switch to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ladybird.org/&#34;&gt;Ladybird&lt;/a&gt; once it&amp;rsquo;s ready for prime-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terminal Emulator and Shell - I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/&#34;&gt;kitty&lt;/a&gt; as my terminal emulator. Mostly because it works by default with Hyprland and very seamlessly at that. It&amp;rsquo;s quick and capable and plays nice with everything I want to do. As for my shell, I like &lt;a href=&#34;https://zsh.sourceforge.io/&#34;&gt;Zsh&lt;/a&gt;. It was the default in Manjaro, so I got used to it, but plugins and such included in zsh are really useful. For more on my zsh configuration, check out my &lt;a href=&#34;/posts/2025-05-18-eosmini-zshrc/&#34;&gt;EOS Mini post about it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Application Launcher - I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/SimplyCEO/wofi&#34;&gt;Wofi&lt;/a&gt; to handle this and a few other things. It works pretty much exactly like the Windows PowerToys launcher or Spotlight on MacOS. I press Super+Space and get a text box and a few commonly used programs. I type in what I want, hit enter and it launches. I&amp;rsquo;m looking to eventually add more to my configuration like being able to start a new markdown file straight from the launcher or pass a search from Wofi to Firefox to be run immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes - I used to use Google Keep for much of this, but lately have moved to &lt;a href=&#34;https://obsidian.md&#34;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s very capable without obfuscating all of your notes in a weird database. It uses markdown for formatting, with the addition of double brackets &lt;code&gt;[[like this]]&lt;/code&gt; to denote a link to another Obsidian note, which makes organization really easy, though I tend to be redundant and put notes in folders anyway. The vault folder also contains the configuration and plugins that you use, so if you were to, for example, synchronize that vault to another device with something like Nextcloud, you get free synchronization between devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Text and Code Editor - OSS Code is a version of Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s very good VS Code editor without the AI junk crammed down your throat. It&amp;rsquo;s still compatible with VS code extensions and has good Github integration. I use it for most of my configuration file editing and basic text editing tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;productivity-and-creation&#34;&gt;Productivity and Creation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are programs for getting things done that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t normally be assumed to be a part of the operating system. My use cases are not your use cases, probably, so there may be better options for you here. This is just what I&amp;rsquo;ve ended up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markdown Text Editor - The program I&amp;rsquo;m writing in &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.marktext.cc/&#34;&gt;MarkText&lt;/a&gt; is a very nice markdown editor. I picked it over other common editors like Obsidian and Typora because it adheres pretty strongly to the markdown standard as written with no proprietary formatting like Obsidian uses and I just plain like the way it looks better than Typora. My MarkText is set to automatically open my blog posts folder when it starts, so I can easily reference old work and save new work in the right place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Office Suite - &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.libreoffice.org/&#34;&gt;LibreOffice&lt;/a&gt; is the default across much of the Linux world for good reason. It supports all the formats I might use and is familiar enough in UI that I can bang out the work I need fairly quickly. It includes answers for word, powerpoint, excel and onenote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Image Editors - I use two image editors, depending on what I&amp;rsquo;m doing. For quick and dirty tasks where I&amp;rsquo;m mostly just manipulating existing images, I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://gimp.org&#34;&gt;Gimp&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m familiar with Gimp since I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it for about fifteen years, but also it&amp;rsquo;s just a very capable photoshop-esque program that runs well. For anything where I&amp;rsquo;m drawing or doing more artistic stuff, I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://krita.org/en&#34;&gt;Krita&lt;/a&gt; which is kind of like Gimp&amp;rsquo;s digital painting focused cousin. While the two share some DNA, it&amp;rsquo;s more common ancestor than common base. The two programs have diverged a fair bit in their direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audio Editing and Recording - While I&amp;rsquo;ve got old experience using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.audacityteam.org/&#34;&gt;Audacity&lt;/a&gt;, I feel like the Digital Audio Workstation environment has been one of the fastest improving and growing areas in creative software. Audacity is old reliable, but I want to learn &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reaper.fm/&#34;&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt; which seems more aimed at what I want to do with audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scanning - I have a Brother laser printer and scanner that I have to begrudgingly pull out of the closet every few months to print or scan something. The print driver is just whatever works with this model of printer, but for scanning, I have found having a dedicated program like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.naps2.com/&#34;&gt;NAPS2&lt;/a&gt; available to be extremely useful. It works with both the feeder and flatbed scanner and can collate pages into a single PDF easily. It&amp;rsquo;s not fancy, it&amp;rsquo;s just a work horse program that I appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;communication&#34;&gt;Communication&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love it or hate it, we use the global net to keep in touch. Thankfully, everything I need is already here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Email - &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thunderbird.net&#34;&gt;Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt; is the long-running email client from the folks at Mozilla and my daily use pick. I like that it has PGP security built in, so I can use end-to-end encryption with my contacts and it has a sensible low-frills interface. It&amp;rsquo;s fast and I adapted pretty quickly from Gmail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chat, Video/Audio Calls - While &lt;a href=&#34;https://discord.com&#34;&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt; is not open source, it&amp;rsquo;s unfortunately where my friends and favorite communities are. If moving people to an open standard was possible, I&amp;rsquo;d be much more bullish about switching to something like Matrix. Unfortunately, I&amp;rsquo;m just stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;media-consumption&#34;&gt;Media Consumption&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I like to have fun on the computer. Here&amp;rsquo;s the stuff that lets me do that. Without these, moving to Linux full time just wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be an option for me at home. I&amp;rsquo;m very thankful that these exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music - While I don&amp;rsquo;t listen to music locally on my machine a whole bunch, I do occasionally fire up a music player to either organize some files or actually listen to something. For the former, I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.strawberrymusicplayer.org/&#34;&gt;Strawberry&lt;/a&gt; and the latter I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://tauonmusicbox.rocks/&#34;&gt;Tauon Music Box&lt;/a&gt;. Strawberry&amp;rsquo;s tagging and organization tools are fantastic, but the program looks kind of ugly. Tauon is beautiful, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t have quite as many tools as Strawberry. It would be nice to find an option that had both halves of this equation, but I&amp;rsquo;m also not precious about it. This setup works remarkably well for my use case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video - None of the video I watch is local to my machine, so a standard like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html&#34;&gt;VLC&lt;/a&gt; isn&amp;rsquo;t really applicable to me. My physical media is all ripped to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://plex.tv&#34;&gt;Plex Media Server&lt;/a&gt; where I watch via a web browser, TV app, or mobile app. I would like to switch to &lt;a href=&#34;https://jellyfin.org/&#34;&gt;Jellyfin&lt;/a&gt; eventually, but I&amp;rsquo;m waiting for their app situation to be a little bit better first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading - I don&amp;rsquo;t read e-books much, but I do read a lot of blogs. For that, I tend to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/yang991178/fluent-reader&#34;&gt;Fluent Reader&lt;/a&gt; on Android, though in doing research for this post, I realize now that Fluent Reader has a desktop app. Maybe I would read more on my computer if I had that installed. To manage all of my RSS subscriptions, I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://freshrss.org/index.html&#34;&gt;FreshRSS&lt;/a&gt; which does have its own fairly good reading UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Games - Like just about every PC gamer, I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampwoered.com&#34;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt; a lot. It&amp;rsquo;s by far the best tool to launch and run modern games, regardless of if you bought them from Steam or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other Game Stores - I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://heroicgameslauncher.com/&#34;&gt;Heroic Launcher&lt;/a&gt; to claim free games from Amazon and (until recently) Epic Games as well as download and install games from Amazon, Epic, and GoG. It&amp;rsquo;s not a perfect option, but it generally works well and I can use it in conjunction with Steam to make games run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emulation - I use a bevy of programs for emulation. For a frontend, I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://es-de.org/&#34;&gt;EmulationStation Desktop Edition&lt;/a&gt; which makes everything look nice. For most old systems (16-bit and earlier) I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.retroarch.com/&#34;&gt;RetroArch&lt;/a&gt; to actually run them, though they&amp;rsquo;re launched through ES-DE. For newer games, I use dedicated emulators. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Rosalie241/RMG&#34;&gt;Rosalie&amp;rsquo;s Mupen64 Gui&lt;/a&gt; for Nintendo 64, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.duckstation.org/&#34;&gt;DuckStation&lt;/a&gt; for Playstation, &lt;a href=&#34;https://pcsx2.net/&#34;&gt;PCSX2&lt;/a&gt; for Playstation 2, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ppsspp.org&#34;&gt;PPSSPP&lt;/a&gt; for PSP, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://dolphin-emu.org&#34;&gt;Dolphin&lt;/a&gt; for GameCube and Wii for starters. I don&amp;rsquo;t tend to dip into DS, 3DS, Wii, Wii-U, PS3, or Xbox emulation much, though with the speed at which &lt;a href=&#34;https://rpcs3.net/&#34;&gt;RPCS3&lt;/a&gt; is developing, it might be worth it to eventually add to my stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other Games - I also play a fair bit of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Majora&amp;rsquo;s Mask via the Ship of Harkanian and 2 Ship 2 Harkanian ports which you can find via the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/harbourMasters&#34;&gt;HarbourMasters&lt;/a&gt; GitHub repo. They&amp;rsquo;ve also got a StarFox 64 port there, so check it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Weeknotes #4</title>
      <link>/posts/2025-05-31-weeknotes4/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 31 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/posts/2025-05-31-weeknotes4/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Really feeling the drag at work because I&amp;rsquo;m so short on days left before switching jobs. As of the posting of this, I&amp;rsquo;ve only got two days left. I feel like I haven&amp;rsquo;t changed my demeanor much toward my coworkers, but they interpret every joke I make as much more bold than I normally would be and attribute that to me leaving. Maybe they&amp;rsquo;re right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I did a lot more writing this week than I expected to. A double header on Monday, the week notes of course, and some drafts in the works too. I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ll swing between heavier and lighter weeks a bit, but I am really enjoying getting to write again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I tried setting up &lt;a href=&#34;https://mierak.github.io/rmpc/&#34;&gt;Rusty Music Player Client&lt;/a&gt; and the daemon it connects to, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t really love the experience. I just think some apps shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be so complicated and a terminal ui just doesn&amp;rsquo;t work for how I&amp;rsquo;d use a music player anyway. I think I&amp;rsquo;ll stick to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.strawberrymusicplayer.org/&#34;&gt;Strawberry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://tauonmusicbox.rocks/&#34;&gt;Tauon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I worked on a &lt;strong&gt;REDACTED&lt;/strong&gt; project this week with &lt;strong&gt;REDACTED&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;REDACTED&lt;/strong&gt;. We even had &lt;strong&gt;REDACTED&lt;/strong&gt; help us out as &lt;strong&gt;REDACTED&lt;/strong&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m really excited to &lt;strong&gt;REDACTED&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;strong&gt;REDACTED&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did a &lt;em&gt;TON&lt;/em&gt; of cleaning up in the yard and garden this morning. Helped Emily move a big Mile High Iris that was falling over, pulled a bajillion weeds, picked up after the dog, and cleaned out the garage. I have to mow tomorrow which i&amp;rsquo;m dreading. It&amp;rsquo;s been raining enough that I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to mow for three weeks. The yard is a jungle. The clover is coming in nicely though!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;playing&#34;&gt;Playing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dipping in slightly to Dark Cloud 2 again. Mostly just due to not really feeling the pull to start anything new that&amp;rsquo;s on the larger side. I probably won&amp;rsquo;t play a whole lot more of it this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picked up Cyberpunk 2077 again, hoping to finish the DLC then go back in to the main story and finish that. I&amp;rsquo;ve done so much side stuff that there can&amp;rsquo;t be &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; much game left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;listening&#34;&gt;Listening:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/fa87551f-de56-4971-a0d1-a3c6eabc913f/side-story-05.mp3?dest-id=4970820&#34;&gt;Side Story&lt;/a&gt; continues to be wonderful. This week&amp;rsquo;s episode on Blue Prince has me wanting to dig back in to the game and unlock more of the deep mysteries, though I&amp;rsquo;ll probably bounce right away anyway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;reading&#34;&gt;Reading:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://joelchrono.xyz/blog/new-desk-and-keyboard/&#34;&gt;Joel got a new desk&lt;/a&gt; and has joined the ranks of the mechanical keyboard typists. I really like the color scheme of his keys. The post somewhat inspired my Tech Loadout post from Monday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I stumbled into the &lt;a href=&#34;https://shellsharks.com/scrolls/scroll/2025-05-16&#34;&gt;Scrolls&lt;/a&gt; blog and really love it. Basically just a shotgun blast of indie web and fediverse stuff to look at in each issue. The next issue is a bit late. I really hope it continues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sophy Wong has started a &lt;a href=&#34;https://sophywong.com/studionotes/2025/5/13/just-start&#34;&gt;Studio Notes&lt;/a&gt; blog. I love this post on some strategies to just start making something. I find myself doing the same things fairly often.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brendon is in Japan and has posted a &lt;a href=&#34;https://wavelengths.online/posts/the-home-screen-in-japan-may-2025&#34;&gt;home screen update&lt;/a&gt; from the trip. I love these kinds of posts, even if I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan of the iOS look.  Now I have to wait for a bit to post mine though so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t look like I&amp;rsquo;m piling on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adam over at &lt;a href=&#34;https://omg.lol&#34;&gt;omg.lol&lt;/a&gt; made a post about their new venture, a &lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.neatnik.net/2025/05/seizing-the-means-of-discovery&#34;&gt;web directory for their members&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m glad that the directory is viewable by non-members. It will join &lt;a href=&#34;https://ooh.directory&#34;&gt;Ooh Directory&lt;/a&gt; in places I visit periodically to find new blogs to follow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;videos&#34;&gt;Videos:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I stumbled upon &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@BreadOnPenguins&#34;&gt;Bread on Penguins&lt;/a&gt; recently. I like how quickly and without fanfare she digs into each topic. I probably won&amp;rsquo;t use everything she features, but I&amp;rsquo;ve picked up a few settings and tools from her videos that I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ll use a lot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <link>/posts/2025-05-26-tech-loadout/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/posts/2025-05-26-tech-loadout/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve spoken a fair bit about using Linux with my Embracing Open Source series, but I realize I&amp;rsquo;ve neglected to give a rundown of what I actually use day to day in a nice, easy to refer to place. So here it is, my complete technology loadout (for now)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;at-the-desk&#34;&gt;At The Desk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My desktop computer is a workhorse. A bit old, and a bit under-powered by today&amp;rsquo;s standards, it still does everything I need and want. It&amp;rsquo;s an understated black mid-size tower, sitting on a bookshelf by the desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-system&#34;&gt;The System:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OS: EndeavourOS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kernel: Linux 6.12.30-1-lts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 3800X&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a home server that lives in my basement. It hosts a variety of private services for myself and my family. I eventually want to include it in my EOS series, but that&amp;rsquo;s probably going to be near the end of the series when I finally get off of most Google services. The machine itself is a smaller mid-size tower on the floor, just plugging along. I&amp;rsquo;d like to move it into a rack at some point, but this is fine for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RAM: 16 GB&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GPU: some old Nvidia GPU, just needed something so the system boots since the CPU doesn&amp;rsquo;t have integrated graphics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storage: 1x 128 GB SATA SSD (OS) and 3x 4 TB 7200 RPM HDD (bulk storage, in a ZFS pool)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-the-living-room&#34;&gt;In The Living Room&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got a couple of things tech-related in the living room. Basically just the gaming machines. The switch I&amp;rsquo;ve had since the console launched. The Optiplex is a bit newer (to me) and was a corporate disposal I was able to pick up on the cheap. Toss a new SSD in there and it makes a pretty great streaming receiver for my desktop PC and can handle some light indie games on its own too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nintendo Switch (Original, bad battery life model)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dell Optiplex with a 11th-gen Core i3 and 128GB SSD running Bazzite&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-my-pockets&#34;&gt;In My Pockets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I carry a few things with me daily. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty normal stuff, but for the sake of completeness, I may as well include it. The watch might be a weird inclusion, but like my Optiplex in the living room, its a corporate disposal I was able to pick up and reset. Funny enough, the factory reset completely removed all of the garbage the company it came from loaded it up with. They didn&amp;rsquo;t even set up their apps on a system partition or anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phone: Google Pixel 7a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OS: Android 15&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Launcher: Niagara Launcher&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TicWatch E3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OS: Android Wear 3.5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anbernic RG34XXSP&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OS: MuOS (Aw Banana)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storage: 1x 128 GB MicroSD, 1x 64 GB MicroSD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laying it all out I&amp;rsquo;m both surprised at how much there is and surprised at how little there is. I don&amp;rsquo;t have an additional laptop, tablet, or e-reader. I don&amp;rsquo;t have extra consoles, and I don&amp;rsquo;t have some VPS in the cloud either.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Declaring Email Bankruptcy</title>
      <link>/posts/2025-05-26-email/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/posts/2025-05-26-email/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Email is a scourge on my existence. No, that&amp;rsquo;s not quite right. &lt;em&gt;Most&lt;/em&gt; email is a scourge on my existence. There, that&amp;rsquo;s better. I&amp;rsquo;ve had my main email account since 2009. That&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of email. At first, I was writing this post while filtering and deleting my email, but at this point, I am calling mail account bankruptcy and am deleting huge swaths of messages. I&amp;rsquo;ll keep some recent stuff, some mail that&amp;rsquo;s important, but basically I&amp;rsquo;m just nuking most of the account from orbit. But how did we get here? How did we get to where I&amp;rsquo;m looking at 30,000 messages wondering if there&amp;rsquo;s something that I will really regret deleting in here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gmail-all-mail-and-15gb-of-free-storage&#34;&gt;Gmail, All Mail, and 15GB of &amp;ldquo;Free Storage&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, some history. On April 1, 2004, google launched Gmail, a free ad-supported webmail client and service. It was an April Fool&amp;rsquo;s joke, but like all the best April Fool&amp;rsquo;s jokes, people actually got something out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of Gmail&amp;rsquo;s whole pitch was that you never have to delete anything ever again. All of your mail will always be there for you in a searchable database with good filtering. Instead of hitting &amp;ldquo;Delete&amp;rdquo; you are supposed to hit &amp;ldquo;Archive&amp;rdquo; where a message will be removed from the inbox, but it&amp;rsquo;ll still hang around in an &amp;ldquo;all mail&amp;rdquo; view. The reason this was possible was another innovation of Gmail. Every user would get a chunk of free storage for their email. It started small-ish, at 1GB, but as peoples&amp;rsquo; accounts aged and email got bigger, with more image attachments and html embedded in the messages, the free storage got bigger. Now, a free Google account will give you 15GB of storage space to be used across Gmail, Google Photos and Google Drive. My 26 years of email alone takes up more than half of that storage allocation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, a modern adage rings true here. If you aren&amp;rsquo;t paying for the service, you&amp;rsquo;re the product. It started innocuous enough. Gmail was a loss leader for Google for a while. Eventually to mitigate some of that, Google started selling advertisements for the Gmail inbox view, and of course, your email is available to them to tailor more advertising to you. In the United States, email 180 days old or older is considered abandoned. That means that everything older than 180 days can be accessed by the government without your consent or knowledge. Twenty six years of my life online All the media piracy sites I had accounts on in college. All of the private conversations Facebook sent me emails about when I was younger. The contents of every single package I&amp;rsquo;ve ever received from Amazon or any other online retailer. All of it is in those 30,000 emails and the vast majority of them are available to the government, and probably advertisers too if I had to guess. It&amp;rsquo;s time for that to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cleaning-up-my-mess&#34;&gt;Cleaning up my mess&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how does one start going about downsizing and categorizing 30,000 messages? Unfortunately, this way leads to madness. The more I filtered, deleted, sorted, filed, and deleted, the more I felt that even the dents I was making weren&amp;rsquo;t worth it. Any reason I&amp;rsquo;d gone back to old email was pretty unnecessary in the grand scheme of things. I started with handy search terms that come up often in mail you don&amp;rsquo;t need. &amp;ldquo;Do not reply&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Unubscribe&amp;rdquo; and such. These led to big numbers of messages getting deleted, and shredding everything from before 2015 helped too, but in the end I&amp;rsquo;d worked on it for six hours across two sessions and landed at 2,979 emails remaining. I was paging through messages 25 at a time until I saw a company name, searching for that name, and deleting the five or ten messages that showed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was really close. I could feel it, but each message deleted felt more and more like defeat. I didn&amp;rsquo;t save my mail like this. Not that I really get physical mail worth saving anyway. No, I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s worth holding onto these messages just because I can. I&amp;rsquo;m glad I looked to see what was even in there, but if this is an exercise at all, it should be an exercise in letting go, not organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-next&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m really not quite sure. I want to get away from Gmail eventually if I can justify paying for email, but I think in the meantime, I&amp;rsquo;ll commit to deleting anything I receive from a company and anything personal will get archived. My overall deadline for deciding on what to do next is in December. By then I have to clear out my Google Drive and Photos accounts because that&amp;rsquo;s when I am switching from encrypted files stored in Drive to real backup of the home server that&amp;rsquo;s acting as the local host for all of that anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, I&amp;rsquo;m hoping my email inbox starts becoming a lot more meaningful as I continue to expand my horizons in the indie web and reach out to other bloggers I like.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Weeknotes #3</title>
      <link>/posts/2025-05-24-weeknotes3/</link>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last weekend was really rough. Just some big deep emotional conversations I don&amp;rsquo;t really want to re-hash or even get sympathy on. I&amp;rsquo;ll process things in my own time. Just mentioning it at all to say that I am okay and my family is okay. I just might be a little more subdued for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a final in person interview with one of the companies I&amp;rsquo;d interviewed with last week and ended up with an offer. I&amp;rsquo;m going to be working IT support for a Managed Service Provider working with a local school district. After getting the offer, I successfully negotiated an even higher wage than I&amp;rsquo;d initially even hoped for. Everyone at the office was really nice and I think I&amp;rsquo;m going to fit in pretty well there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relatedly, I handed in my notice at the old job fixing wheelchairs. It was a kind of down note, but at the same time I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m being encouraged to chase the next thing, which is nice. Definitely a job where I would highly recommend my manager and most of the team to anyone looking for work, but would absolutely never ever ever recommend the company I worked for. This is the first company I&amp;rsquo;ve ever thought about writing a review for at all and it&amp;rsquo;s because I would give it negative stars if I could. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably establish at this new job for a few months before actually writing that review though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been continuing my email conversations with &lt;a href=&#34;https://joelchrono.xyz&#34;&gt;Joel&lt;/a&gt; though the pace is a little more manageable now. It&amp;rsquo;s really great to have a sort of net-pen-pal, if that&amp;rsquo;s the term. Especially someone who gets Linux stuff, which I really don&amp;rsquo;t have in my personal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been sucked into the well that is &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/881100/Noita/&#34;&gt;Noita&lt;/a&gt;. I knew that it was deep, but I had no idea it was &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; deep. It has the depth of open world survival games like Minecraft or Terraria in terms of material interactions, has roguelike build tuning that would put Balatro and Binding of Isaac to shame, and is lovingly coated with a layer of deep Finnish folklore-flavored alchemy-fueled lore. The sheer ambition in this game is staggering and I feel like it will be a classic for a long time to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife and I are continuing our trek through Season 2 of Twin Peaks. It&amp;rsquo;s a little slow going with the long episodes, but I&amp;rsquo;m still enjoying it immensely. I cannot fathom that most or all of the questions will have answers by the end (especially knowing the show&amp;rsquo;s troubled continuation and extremely late third season) but it&amp;rsquo;s so specific in its vision that I find it enthralling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I hadn&amp;rsquo;t really considered when I first started doing weeknotes, but I have come to really enjoy when I&amp;rsquo;m reading weeknotes by other bloggers, is a short list of recommended reading or follows. Here&amp;rsquo;s this week&amp;rsquo;s list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phil and Logan re-launched their site this week with new branding and everything. Gordon Hamburger is now &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.70percentcomplete.com/welcome-to-70-complete/&#34;&gt;70% Complete&lt;/a&gt;. I really like the rebrand. The logo treatment and re-introduction post are really great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been going through some of Ben Kimmel&amp;rsquo;s blog, &lt;a href=&#34;https://thewrittenaddiction.com&#34;&gt;The Written Addiction&lt;/a&gt; and enjoying it quite a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I don&amp;rsquo;t quite have the same relationship to music as Amin, I really liked &lt;a href=&#34;https://benjaminhollon.com/musings/listening-to-less-music/&#34;&gt;his post&lt;/a&gt; about listening to less music and having a more intentional relationship with the medium. I feel like I probably am similar to him except you could easily replace music with podcasts. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s time I take a hard look at what I listen to each week and whittle down the list. Especially with my new job being less podcast friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>EOS Mini: zshrc</title>
      <link>/posts/2025-05-18-eosmini-zshrc/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 18 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/posts/2025-05-18-eosmini-zshrc/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the first Embracing Open Source mini! There are a ton of Linux-adjacent topics that aren&amp;rsquo;t often covered as a part of bigger series, so I wanted to highlight those smaller topics in mini posts. Today&amp;rsquo;s subject is the &lt;code&gt;.zshrc&lt;/code&gt; file. If you use fish, dash, bash, or any other shell, this won&amp;rsquo;t really be specific to you, but you may still find some value here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A command line window is made up of two things in Linux. The first, more obvious one is the Terminal Emulator. This is the program that displays the text from the system that describes commands happening on the system and allows you to interact with and start those commands. The other part is the shell itself. You can think of the shell as the program that interprets what you write into it into commands to give to the system. I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/&#34;&gt;kitty&lt;/a&gt; as my terminal emulator and &lt;a href=&#34;https://zsh.sourceforge.io/&#34;&gt;zsh&lt;/a&gt; (Z Shell) as my shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;.zshrc&lt;/code&gt; is the file that zsh looks at every time it&amp;rsquo;s opened to set its configuration. The overall configuration for zsh is loaded at different times from different files. For example, if you log into the computer with zsh, then it will load &lt;code&gt;.zprofile&lt;/code&gt; at login. All of these files are normally stored at &lt;code&gt;/home/username&amp;gt;/&lt;/code&gt;. Since I log in using SDDM, the only zsh config file I use is &lt;code&gt;.zshrc&lt;/code&gt;. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at the file. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, we&amp;rsquo;ll do it in chunks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;## Environment Variables&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Default Programs&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;EDITOR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;code&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;BROWSER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;firefox&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Follow XDG Base Dir Specifications&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;SAVEHIST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;1000000&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;HISTCONTROL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;ignoreboth &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Ignores duplicate and commands starting with a space&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the first section of my config. It looks like a lot, but really it&amp;rsquo;s not too bad. The comments should guide us a bit. In case you&amp;rsquo;ve never seen scripting before, a comment is a line that the computer doesn&amp;rsquo;t try to interpret. In this config, comments start with one or more hashes (#). As you can see, then, the first section sets some environment variables for default editor and browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we have the XDG directory specification. These are commonly used locations for specific types of data. Configuration files should go into &lt;code&gt;/home/&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;/.config/&lt;/code&gt; for example. The &lt;code&gt;$HOME&lt;/code&gt; variable here translates to the &lt;code&gt;/home/&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; part, so if anyone else put this line into their config, it would still work. the &lt;code&gt;XDG_DATA_HOME&lt;/code&gt; can be thought of as &lt;code&gt;%APPDATA%&lt;/code&gt; on a Windows machine, basically a home-folder-bound place to store application files so that the user doesn&amp;rsquo;t need extended permissions to use them. The cache directory is where applications should stick their temporary files. The State directory is like a &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; more important version of the cache. It should house data for applications that they may need between restarts, but isn&amp;rsquo;t important enough to go into the data directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we have the history file setup. The less history file stores output history anytime the user uses the -less flag on a command or opens manual pages by executing &lt;code&gt;man &amp;lt;command&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. The Python history is for python commands, of course. The HISTFILE variable sets up where zsh should send command history. The options after are for the total number of lines to store and how much of that should be stored between sessions. The next line, as the comment says, tells zsh to ignore repeated commands or commands that start with a space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s another section. The first part adds my home folder Scripts directory to the PATH variable so they can be called from anywhere. You might recall a script that would be useful to call from anywhere from the &lt;a href=&#34;/content/posts/2025-05-16-newsite&#34;&gt;How the new Taming Knots works&lt;/a&gt;. This is where that script lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following section is just setting up environment variables for a bunch of stuff I have installed to make them use the correct XDG directories, since not all programs follow the specification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Source external files&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Load modules&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Completion Options&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;zstyle &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;:completion:*&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; menu &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Set completion menu to TAB&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;zstyle &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;:completion:*&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; list-colors &lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(s.:.)LS_COLORS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;si&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;ma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;0&lt;span class=&#34;se&#34;&gt;\;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;33&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Colorize the completion menu&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;zstyle &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;:completion:*&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; squeeze-slashes &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Explicitly disabled to allow /*/ expansion&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next section sets up colors for TTY, then starts loading modules. The first two lines are to set up the Zsh completion module. This module gives me a menu when autocomplete finds multiple entries that fit what&amp;rsquo;s been typed so far. The next module sets up color highlighting for commands, including the completion menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/2025-05-18-16-25-24-image.png&#34; alt=&#34;an example of the completion menu in action&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next section is options for the completion module. The comments are pretty self explanatory here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;#Main options&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;setopt append_history inc_append_history share_history &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# History improvements:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# History is appended rather than overwriting, is appended as code is executed, &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# and is shared across sessions&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;setopt auto_menu menu_complete &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Autocomplete first menu match&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;setopt autocd &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Type the name of a dir to CD into it&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;setopt auto_param_slash &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# When a dir is autocompleted, add a slash, not a space&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;setopt no_case_glob no_case_match &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# makes autocomplete not case sensitive&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;setopt globdots &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# include dotfiles in autocomplete&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;setopt extended_glob &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# matches ~,#,^&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;setopt interactive_comments &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# allow comments in shell&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;setopt notify &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# notify in terminal when a long process completes&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;stty stop undef &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# stops accidental terminal stop&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next section is where we get into zsh&amp;rsquo;s main options. The first one sets up some extra history stuff to make it easier to go back and check it later. The next option sets up completion so that it will automatically write what I select from the menu, so I can just keep typing to get a longer path or set arguments when running a command. The next one is really nice, it lets me &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt;, or change directory, without typing cd at the beginning of the command. For example, if I open a new shell and want to get to the Taming Knots files, I could just type &lt;code&gt;doc&amp;lt;TAB&amp;gt;P&amp;lt;TAB&amp;gt;t&amp;lt;TAB&amp;gt;&amp;lt;Return&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to get to &lt;code&gt;Documents/Projects/taming-knots&lt;/code&gt;. Similarly, the next option just makes the autocomplete end with a slash unless another key is pressed so that it&amp;rsquo;s set up for moving through directories automatically and the next option makes it so that the shell doesn&amp;rsquo;t care about case &lt;em&gt;only in the context of autocomplete&lt;/em&gt;. Useful if I don&amp;rsquo;t know what case a file might use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The glob options below make it easier to match to files with special characters or hidden files. Interactive comments adds comments to the shell itself when running commands. By default, zsh doesn&amp;rsquo;t send a notification to the system when a long command finishes. Setting the Notify option fixes that. The last one on the list is disabling the ctrl+S hotkey, which normally stops the terminal in its tracks. I never use it and it causes more problems than it solves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# keybinds &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;bindkey &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;^a&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; beginning-of-line

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Use Oh My Posh for prompt&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Import colorscheme from &amp;#39;wal&amp;#39; asynchronously&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# &amp;amp;   # Run the process in the background.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# ( ) # Hide shell job control messages.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Not supported in the &amp;#34;fish&amp;#34; shell.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;cat ~/.cache/wal/sequences &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Final section! The first two just set some useful keybinds to go to the start or end of a line. The next one tells zsh to load up &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohmyposh.dev/&#34;&gt;Oh My Posh&lt;/a&gt; to make the prompt prettier. Finally, the last line tells the terminal to use colors from my wallpaper using &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/eylles/pywal16&#34;&gt;PyWal16&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, my configuration is pretty tame, but so seldom do I see examples of configurations in Linux that I figured it would be a good idea to share and explain what I&amp;rsquo;ve done and why.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Weeknotes #2</title>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got off of my six-day workweek last week and dove straight into a day and a half of cleaning the house and getting the yard back into shape. I was dead tired after, but this week has been more-ish relaxing, thankfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a wonderful email from a reader and fellow blogger (Check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://joelchrono.xyz/&#34;&gt;Joel’s blog here&lt;/a&gt;.) I’m sure he would say it isn’t much, but I do really appreciate the contact. It’s amazing how much motivation just one message gave me to keep going. We&amp;rsquo;ve since been carrying on a longer conversation back and forth. I hope I can forge similar friendships with other bloggers around both the Worst Garbage Online community and in the wider &amp;rsquo;net as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had three interviews this week. The first was with a law firm. I think I did well on it. The second was with a Managed Service Provider over the phone. I must have done well with it because they wanted to schedule a video interview the very next day. That video interview was the third one. The same company that wanted a video interview right away reached out &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt; and I&amp;rsquo;m now going in to the office to speak to them in person Monday. I had a fourth interview scheduled for a penetration testing company, but the rep dropped out last minute. I guess a meeting went over time. Hopefully we can re-connect sometime next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taming Knots has a new home! I love Pika.page, but I was interested in seeing what self-hosting a site would look like. Then I realized site hosting and email hosting are &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; two things I really don&amp;rsquo;t want to do on my home server because they&amp;rsquo;re annoying to set up and my ISP probably won&amp;rsquo;t like me hosting on my personal connection. I opted for using Hugo with GitHub Pages instead. I don&amp;rsquo;t love hosting it on GitHub, which is owned by Microsoft, but the documentation is just so much better when working with GitHub, so I&amp;rsquo;m kind of stuck. The nice thing is that storage space is not really a concern, especially given how light Hugo&amp;rsquo;s sites are and as long as I stay under 30,000 files, I won&amp;rsquo;t draw the ire of GitHub, so for now on a technical level, it&amp;rsquo;s the perfect host for my little project, especially since the hosting is free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve set up local mail clients both on my PC and on my phone. In addition, I&amp;rsquo;ve started using PGP encryption on email. I am still using Gmail, but I&amp;rsquo;d like to eventually move away from the service along with most other Google stuff. I know using encryption for something like Email makes me seem a bit like a crank, but to be honest it&amp;rsquo;s boilerplate privacy tech. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably go over PGP basics in a future &lt;a href=&#34;/content/posts/2025-05-15-EOS3&#34;&gt;Embracing Open Source&lt;/a&gt; post, but for now if you want my pub key, just ask!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m back on my bullshit again, playing Dark Cloud 2. It&amp;rsquo;s like a comfy warm blanket of a game to me at this point. I normally am very much against upscaled texture packs for old games, but I figured I&amp;rsquo;d try it this time just to see. So far, everything looks pretty great except for the inventory icons, which are still jagged and low resolution. There&amp;rsquo;s probably just not enough detail there for an algorithm to upscale them while still looking nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife and I finished Season 1 of Twin Peaks, so now we&amp;rsquo;re on to Season 2. I&amp;rsquo;m fully in new stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen before, so I&amp;rsquo;m excited to go through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>How the new Taming Knots works</title>
      <link>/posts/2025-05-16-newsite/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/posts/2025-05-16-newsite/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello dear reader, and welcome to the brand new Taming Knots! I would say it&amp;rsquo;s improved, but&amp;hellip; well it arguably hasn&amp;rsquo;t. But at least it hasn&amp;rsquo;t really gotten worse either. Because of this change, I want to do a rundown of how the site works now, my workflow going forward, and what that means for my writing here. Before all that, though, I should go over the old site a bit and explain &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; I would want to move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;goodbye-pikapage&#34;&gt;Goodbye, Pika.page&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://taming-knots.pika.page/posts/taming-knots-has-moved&#34;&gt;moving post&lt;/a&gt; on Pika, I love Pika Page and everything else Good Enough makes. They seem to have a really great vision for the kinds of things they want to make and how to make those sustainable. To be perfectly honest, I&amp;rsquo;m kind of sad to not use their platform anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons I&amp;rsquo;m moving away from Pika are twofold. First, and the most practical thing, is that I am a very cheap person generally. It&amp;rsquo;s very hard for me to justify spending sixty dollars a year or more (with a domain) on the blog when cheaper options that meet the same requirements are available. I put myself under very stringent budgetary constraints regularly. I understand that, for a lot of folks, sixty bucks isn&amp;rsquo;t a lot and they are right. But what if I could host the blog for free on Github Pages in exchange for a little extra work on my end? That suddenly removes a ton of pressure for me to write continuously and allows me to have more fun with the writing of the blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second reason is kind of linked up with that last point. I am finding a lot of enjoyment in building out a layer of services that I maintain myself or at least allow me to do some more nuts and bolts work on them. I&amp;rsquo;ve set up media streaming, cloud-less cloud storage, an RSS reader and subscription server, and a few other things for my home server. I originally also wanted to host the blog there, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s more secure to put a separation between my personal files and the public blog. As a sort of half-step measure between having a fully managed service to blog on and hosting it myself, I&amp;rsquo;ve taken to using a static site generator to build and maintain the blog, but using a separate service provider to host it. The benefit? this service provider&amp;rsquo;s free limitations are extremely generous. I could write thousands of posts, even with images and not run out of space. But I&amp;rsquo;m getting ahead of myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;enter-hugo&#34;&gt;Enter Hugo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; is a static site generator. Most websites on the internet are dynamic, offering interactive elements, tracking, analytics, advertising, and myriad other bells and whistles. Hugo, and similar generators like Jekyll or 11ty, work by taking some input files, usually markdown text, applying a set of HTML and/or CSS templates to them, then spitting out static HTML webpages. These pages are light and fast to load, even on slow mobile networks and thanks to the HTML and CSS, they look pretty nice too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started by trying Jekyll, since it came recommended by my blog pal, Joel. I ran into a snag when I tried to deploy the site though, so I eventually dropped it. I briefly looked at 11ty, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t really like the setup for it. The last one I tried, Hugo, was immediately the one I stuck with. There were a few false starts surrounding theming, but eventually I realized that I was thinking about modifying an existing theme all wrong and got everything up and running fairly smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/2025-05-16-21-49-37-image.png&#34; alt=&#34;The website directory&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site directory is laid out in a sensible way. &lt;code&gt;archetypes&lt;/code&gt; holds the basic layout for the front matter for blog posts. &lt;code&gt;assets&lt;/code&gt; holds an override for the theme&amp;rsquo;s colors (more on that in a minute) and exists to hold site assets like the favicon or other commonly used images, scss, or css that will be used all over the site. &lt;code&gt;content&lt;/code&gt; is where the posts and pages live (in their own subfolders.) &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; is a folder for shortcode that can take input data from another source and output it in a nice format inside a post. I don&amp;rsquo;t forsee myself using that one much. &lt;code&gt;i18n&lt;/code&gt; is for localization content, basically allowing the blog to be multilingual if only it were so easy for me to pick up another language. &lt;code&gt;layouts&lt;/code&gt; is for overrides to default page layouts set by the theme. &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; is where Hugo outputs the final site in HTML for consumption. &lt;code&gt;resources&lt;/code&gt; holds the resources the code snippets in &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; take as input. &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; is where images that are hosted on the blog go. Finally, the &lt;code&gt;themes&lt;/code&gt; directory is where the site&amp;rsquo;s theme, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hugo-sid/hugo-blog-awesome&#34;&gt;hugo-blog-awesome&lt;/a&gt; lives. The directory structure of the theme is basically identical to the base hugo structure. The theme&amp;rsquo;s files act as a base and the main directory override those files. For example, this is what &lt;code&gt;themes/hugo-blog-awesome/assets/sass/main.scss&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rsquo;s first two sections look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-scss&#34; data-lang=&#34;scss&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;//////////////// 1.

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;$dark-white&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;#eaeaea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;$dark-light&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;#00406d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;$dark-smoke&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;#00284b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;$dark-gray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mh&#34;&gt;#42474e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the colors have been changed. This override file lets me change those colors without modifying anything else about the theme. Similarly I can make modified copies of anything in the &lt;code&gt;themes&lt;/code&gt; directory to make new overrides to change other parts of how the site looks. In fact, the &lt;code&gt;hugo.toml&lt;/code&gt; file in the root of the site is itself an override of the theme&amp;rsquo;s version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;writing&#34;&gt;Writing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned before, all of the site&amp;rsquo;s content is in markdown files and images. Markdown syntax is really easy to write in and provides &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; easy layout options. It turns &lt;code&gt;*this* **weirdly formatted** *text*&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;weirdly formatted&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;text&lt;/em&gt;. It can handle lists, ordered lists, links, and a bunch of other useful stuff. When sent through the Hugo parser, you can even mix HTML with Markdown. That&amp;rsquo;s how I&amp;rsquo;ve embedded the Letterbird contact form for the site in the &lt;a href=&#34;/pages/contact/&#34;&gt;Contact Page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; I write the posts, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried a few markdown editors and I&amp;rsquo;ve landed on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.marktext.cc/&#34;&gt;MarkText&lt;/a&gt; It does a few things for me that I really like. It can be set up to open a directory of files in the sidebar automatically so I can easily reference old posts. It supports front matter in the format Hugo expects (although I do wish it could automatically add the parameters that Hugo expects in the front matter.) It also supports automatically adding images from the clipboard or dragged into the editor to the site&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; directory. When an image is added to the editor, it uses this syntax to automatically embed the image. &lt;code&gt;![](/../../static/img.png)&lt;/code&gt;. Hugo doesn&amp;rsquo;t technically need the &lt;code&gt;/../../static&lt;/code&gt; part, but this setup allows the MarkText preview to correctly display images and doesn&amp;rsquo;t break anything for the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a post is written and ready to publish, I flip the &lt;code&gt;draft = &lt;/code&gt; parameter in the front matter to true, then save the file in &lt;code&gt;/content/posts&lt;/code&gt;. With everything staged and ready, I open a terminal and execute my deployment script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deployment script is a tiny, simple shell script that just combines a few commands for me. It looks something like this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;#!/bin/bash
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;CWD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;pwd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; /home/brent/Documents/Projects/taming-knots
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;hugo
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;git add -A
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;git commit -m &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Updated Blog&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;git push
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;$CWD&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The script saves the currently open directory in a variable, &lt;code&gt;CWD&lt;/code&gt;, then changes to the location of the blog folder. The &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; command makes Hugo build the site locally first. It&amp;rsquo;s not necessary for me, but I like to see if it hits any errors right away. Then, the script looks for and adds any changed or new files to a commit, writes a commit message, then pushes the change to GitHub Pages before setting the terminal directory back to where it was open previously. The script is saved into a &lt;code&gt;~/.scripts/&lt;/code&gt; folder that I have added to my &lt;code&gt;$PATH&lt;/code&gt; so that I can invoke it from anywhere in the system and it will still work and put me right back where I was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;deployment&#34;&gt;Deployment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the files are pushed to GitHub, the repository automatically runs the build and deploy action through a GitHub Workflow. I use the one Hugo&amp;rsquo;s developers recommend with no modification at all, so I won&amp;rsquo;t clog up the post by pasting it here. It basically just sets up a temporary environment just to run the &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; command, then deploys everything in the &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; folder to the Github Pages url. Adding a new post takes about thirty seconds. Not too shabby for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site is hosted on GitHub Pages, but the domain I use is registered with &lt;a href=&#34;https://porkbun.com/&#34;&gt;Porkbun&lt;/a&gt;. Porkbun is my name server as well, so I just have it set up with an A record to forward to GitHub Pages and I put the domain in to the Github Pages control panel for the repository to make sure it gets forwarded to the right place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wrapping-up&#34;&gt;Wrapping up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welp that&amp;rsquo;s about it. I might go deeper into how I set up the site in the first place, but honestly Hugo is so easy to work with that I would recommend just going for it and trying it yourself if you&amp;rsquo;re curious. The official documentation is great as well. Sure it&amp;rsquo;s a little more fiddly than the excellent Pika.page editor, but it was fun and interesting to set up and now I have a complete, working offline copy of the site with backups of all of my posts so if anything happens to Taming Knots, I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to put it back up somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Embracing Open Source Part 3: The Year of the Linux Desktop</title>
      <link>/posts/2025-05-15-eos3/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/posts/2025-05-15-eos3/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post is a part of my Embracing Open Source series. You can read the last post&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;/posts/2025-05-02-eos2/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, or if you are particularly interested in a related topic or want to get in touch with me about the series, please&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;/pages/contact/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;send me a message&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “Year of the Linux Desktop” has been so often repeated and shouted about, especially from the maintainers of Linux distributions that it may be the biggest joke in the entire Linux community. I think this joke continues to exist for a couple of reasons. The first is that the idea of any Linux distribution being friendly enough that a user never ever has to type a command or edit a file is laughable. The second is that, for most Linux users, that friendliness comes with limitations that they’re just not interested in. So the joke stays and will stay with us to the heat death of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t misunderstand me here. Linux is still perfectly usable on the desktop and, depending on distribution and desktop environment, can be used almost exclusively using the graphic user interface rather than a command-line interface. The key operator here is &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt;. Unlike the previous posts, this is going to be a lot looser with less real advice. I’m mostly just going to try to explain why I use the things I do. This is building off of Part 2 in this series, so if you aren’t familiar with things like linux distributions, then please go back and read that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;kde-plasma&#34;&gt;KDE Plasma&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t use Plasma day-to-day anymore, but I do still keep the desktop environment on my machine for a couple of good reasons. Firstly, if I ever have an application that misbehaves on my tiling window manager setup in Hyprland, I can flip over to Plasma quickly to make it work. The second reason is that it&amp;rsquo;s a good way to have a very robust set of basic utilities you&amp;rsquo;d expect to find on any modern operating system that might not be packaged with a more do-it-yourself style desktop environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/&#34;&gt;KDE Plasma&lt;/a&gt; is the default desktop environment for Manjaro, and is available as an edition or flavor of nearly every other Linux distribution, including the one that I use, &lt;a href=&#34;https://endeavouros.com/&#34;&gt;Endeavour OS&lt;/a&gt;. KDE is robust and well-maintained, with an extensive suite of packaged applications that are often recommended as the best in class option to fill each role. For example, Kate, the text editor is great and is only barely upstaged by Code, the open source version of Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s excellent Visual Studio Code text editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plasma works similarly to Windows&amp;rsquo;s desktop environment. By default you get a panel along the bottom of the screen with an application launcher, task manager, and system tray. The desktop supports icons, shortcuts, folders and files. Your system settings are all located in the KDE settings application which is honestly better than what Microsoft provided for the entirety of Windows 8 and through most of Windows 10. Windows are floating unless you make them fullscreen, and plasma even supports windows-esque snapping. Overall it&amp;rsquo;s a very familiar and safe option to use as a desktop environment while still looking very stylish and modern. It&amp;rsquo;s hands down my pick for a desktop environment if you&amp;rsquo;re coming from Windows and looking to try your hand at Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hyprland&#34;&gt;Hyprland&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if I don&amp;rsquo;t use KDE, what is the desktop that I do use like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear reader, I warn you. This way lies madness.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyprland is what people pick when they enjoy the setup of a system just as much as actually using it for doing things. When you first install it, you are constantly adding extra bits and pieces, editing text files to change the configuration, and spending just as much time in a text editor and terminal as you would normally be spending watching &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emUCJL4CCfs&#34;&gt;videos of ravens asking if they&amp;rsquo;re a good boy&lt;/a&gt;. Once you get everything just right though? you find more things to tinker with. BUT THEN if you get all those things set up the way you like, it&amp;rsquo;s a dream to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paradigm for how windows work on basically any other OS is tossed out the window with a tiling window manager. When I open a program in Hyprland, it fills the screen automatically. If I open another window, it will automatically resize the existing window to be half the screen and the new window will fill in the other half. Keep opening new windows and the space will keep subdividing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/hypr-subdivide.png&#34; alt=&#34;This is what Hyprland looks like with 10 windows open on a single desktop.&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With hotkeys, you can move windows around, re-arrange the layout, and even convert a tiled window into a floating one. In this way, the tiling window manager is kind of the opposite of modern floating window desktop environments. In KDE you can snap as an option. In Hyprland, snapping is the default and a floating window is an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other big difference is in customization. I&amp;rsquo;m not talking just visual theming, though that certainly is something you can do with Hyprland. What I mean is that every default, every hotkey, every single thing that Hyprland does on a surface level view, is controlled by a single configuration file. Because that file is explicit in its construction, you can change anything you want. For example, on my install of Hyprland, if I press Super (the windows key) and E, it will open Thunar, my file manager. I specified Thunar as the default program in the Hyprland config, then manually set a keybind to open the default file manager further down the config file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way Hyprland&amp;rsquo;s configuration works is a sort of &amp;ldquo;best-practice&amp;rdquo; in Linux and in window managers especially. If a component is built for use with window managers, all of the defaults will be explicitly written into the config file and you are encouraged to make any edits you want to that config in order to make it yours. Similarly, since Hyprland doesn&amp;rsquo;t come with a lot of things, like a task bar, system tray, lock screen, notification center, or even a clock, you are expected and encouraged to install those components separately and the development community has done a wonderful job of supplying sample configurations and varied examples of each component. Here&amp;rsquo;s a list of what I&amp;rsquo;ve landed on with regards to customization components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waybar - Similar to a Desktop Environment Panel, or taskbar in Windows terminology, except Waybar is extremely customizable. My install doesn&amp;rsquo;t even really look like a task bar. It&amp;rsquo;s just a couple clusters of icons and useful information at the top corners of each of my screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyprlock - A lock screen built for use with Hyprland. I can hit Super+L to lock my screen and hide open applications. The config is extremely open ended though, so you can really make your lock screen look however you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wofi - An application launcher similar to Apple&amp;rsquo;s spotlight. Super+Spacebar pulls up a floating window with a text prompt. I type in what I want to launch and it automatically populates and updates a list of programs. Enter to launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wlogout - A tool to quickly log out, shut down, or reboot my computer. Super+M brings up the menu, and I can select options by clicking or using the arrow keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SwayNC - A notification center. It integrates with Waybar and I have them themed similarly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SpectacleRC - A screenshot tool. Super+S starts the tool and I can click and drag to select an area to get a screenshot of. Screenshots automatically get put in my clipboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clipse - A clipboard manager. Has a dedicated terminal UI that will show up with Super+V&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if I use Hyprland and like it, why not recommend it widely? I think it&amp;rsquo;s pretty safe to say that most people don&amp;rsquo;t want to and shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to type in settings for their programs line by line in a configuration file. It&amp;rsquo;s just not a great experience for most people. There are, however, the sickos out there like me that enjoy the setup process. For those people, a simple description of what Hyprland is and how it is configured will be plenty to make them go try it on their own regardless of what I&amp;rsquo;m saying I recommend or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, whatever you use is great if it works for you. And if you decide to go down the Window Manager hole with me, then I salute you!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I want to get into the habit of writing more often. &lt;a href=&#34;https://gilest.org/doingweeknotes/index.html&#34;&gt;Weeknotes&lt;/a&gt; seems like a good way to hone the skill a bit and reflect on prior weeks as I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I did an extra day of work this week, my overtime clocked in at around 9 hours for the pay period. My notes are probably going to be really light because of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I did twelve job applications. I got emails to set up interviews on two of my previous applications from last week or the week before. I also got a call on one, but the pay was too low.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My wife and I have continued to plug along in Twin Peaks. We’re almost done with the first season. I’m surprised she’s liking it as much as she is. I hope the remainder of the show doesn’t leave her cold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wrote two blog posts last week in my “Embracing Open Source” series. These were mostly background. I’m looking forward to the second “part” of the series where I go into detail about my setup and experiences with Linux as a daily driver OS and &lt;a href=&#34;https://hyprland.org/&#34;&gt;Hyprland&lt;/a&gt; as my most recent desktop environment love.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn’t do much gaming this week. I mostly just came home and slept after work. I did check out the demo for &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2533600/Bloodthief/&#34;&gt;BloodThief&lt;/a&gt; though and it seems like a really fantastic speed game. It will be interesting to see how much the developer leans in to it. So far it seems like a lot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’ve been futzing with my RSS reader setup a lot these past few days, trying to find good blogs to subscribe to. Today I got &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.rsshub.app/&#34;&gt;RSS Hub&lt;/a&gt; set up to compliment my existing &lt;a href=&#34;https://freshrss.org/index.html&#34;&gt;FreshRSS&lt;/a&gt; install. Now, I can use RSS Hub to dig up and generate RSS feeds for more stuff on the internet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tonight is Chinese food and digging into &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3567760/Twigs_Adventure_64/&#34;&gt;Twig’s Adventure 64&lt;/a&gt;, a game by a developer I really like that specializes in little collectathon platformers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Embracing Open Source Part 2: Linux</title>
      <link>/posts/2025-05-02-eos2/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/posts/2025-05-02-eos2/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post is a part of my Embracing Open Source series. You can read the last post &lt;a href=&#34;/posts/2025-04-30-eos1/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, or if you are particularly interested in a related topic or want to get in touch with me about the series, please &lt;a href=&#34;/pages/contact/&#34;&gt;send me a message&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux is a tough topic to wade into, but this will be a pretty general overview of my path into using the open source operating system for the last year and change, as well as some general recommendations and best practices to keep in mind when trying to dive in yourself. My recommendations shouldn’t be taken as gospel, and everything I say is up to your interpretation anyway, so if you have a different preference, then that’s great! Part of what makes Linux such a great OS to use is that there’s so many options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I wrote in my previous post, I’ve been a casual observer of Linux for a long time, only dipping my toes in here and there. At some point in the fall of 2023, however, I decided I’d like to try to fully dive in to running Linux and only Linux as much as I could. At first, it started as a kind of fun challenge for myself, but I quickly found out that I just prefer the way Linux handles a lot of things. Here’s how things progressed for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late 2023, I installed a second hard drive in my primary desktop PC. I installed Manjaro to it so that I could leave the Windows drive intact for my wife to use whenever she wanted to use my computer for something. Over the next year or so, I made small modifications to the system, tinkering here or there when I tried to do something and couldn’t or wanted to use a new program that wasn’t in the default repositories. I figured out how Systemd Mount Units work, installed the KDE Discover store, set up flatpak, and used Proton with non-steam games. I dipped my toes ever so slightly into the terminal. I even tried to install some things from the AUR (Arch User Repository) which didn’t work, but I assumed it was something I was doing wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, I started to understand what kind of OS I’d installed. My previous Linux experience was with Ubuntu and Linux Mint, both of which do major releases once or twice a year, with minor updates in between. Manjaro, on the other hand, is a rolling release. That means that packages go live very quickly without being held back for a major version change of the underlying system. I liked this change. It felt like I was getting new features more frequently and stuff was staying up to date better. I also was having less in the way of programs insisting that their dependencies were out of date than in my previous experience. Overall I had a good time. There were problems, though, that I would only start to discover later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, I switched to EndeavourOS, which is less of a distribution all its own and more an installation script that runs after a basic Arch Linux install to set up some basics that Arch normally doesn’t give you right off the bat. Manjaro is also based on Arch, but they have different repositories and a different methodology for package releases, which means packages can be out of date. Normally this isn’t a big deal, but anytime you try to use the AUR, those build files will often insist on having the latest packages and will fail if they aren’t available. Overall, Manjaro feels like it’s bolted on to the existing OS, while EndeavourOS feels like a layer of helpful tools that floats on top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current EndeavourOS experience is that the AUR works, I use the terminal a lot more, and I’ve had to fight with a few things here and there to get everything working just right. It’s not all roses, but if something isn’t working quite as expected, I usually can figure out what is going on and fix it. More reliance on the terminal is kind of a blessing in disguise. Oh, and I’m using Hyprland, which is a tiling window manager (more on that in a bit) that looks really snazzy and is a joy to use, but is also completely different to how I used to use my computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;picking-a-distribution&#34;&gt;Picking a Distribution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so you’re feeling emboldened. Maybe you want to install it on a virtual machine first. Maybe you want to just dive right in. Either way, you need to pick a distribution. Linux itself is just the kernel. You can’t really use plain Linux as an operating system, so maintainers and developers will build out distributions, versions of the OS that are the same kernel underneath, but might have different packages surrounding that kernel. There’s a few things to keep in mind when picking a distribution to try. How big is the team behind it and how big is the community? Does the distribution use a rolling release, or a set release schedule? Is the distribution based on something else, or is it its own top level thing? Is it immutable? Let’s go through these one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, the team size behind a distribution and the size/activity level of the community is huge. Unlike a commercial OS, no one is being paid to support you if something breaks or isn’t working right. The community around a Linux distro and the size of the team behind it does a lot to show you how likely it is that someone out there has an answer for your question. Ubuntu, for example, has a big team at Canonical running the show and the community is pretty extensive. Arch, on the other hand, has a slightly smaller community, but the activity level and knowledge of that community is huge. Generally, I’d suggest staying away from distributions with small teams or communities. Stick to well recognized names. Fedora, Arch and Ubuntu are all good starting points. Which one to go with will depend on the other factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, consider the stream. Is the distribution you’re considering downstream from something else? Some distributions are based on others. For example, Manjaro is based on Arch. Ubuntu is based on Debian. Linux Mint is based on Ubuntu. Sometimes this is a benefit. If something isn’t working in Linux Mint, the likelihood of a solution for Ubuntu working is pretty high. That said, every layer of abstraction from the upstream sources means updates will take longer to get to you and you might have to contend with distribution-specific changes which negates the increased community size from being based on something else, like there’s some issues I had in Manjaro that couldn’t be fixed by looking for Arch knowledge because those issues came from the way Manjaro’s maintainers handle packages and hold some back for more testing. I decided to go with EndeavourOS partially because it leaves basically all of the base Arch distro intact, while just doing some of the setup footwork for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows and Mac users will be used to the periodic release schedule of something like Ubuntu. Every year, Ubuntu releases new versions in April and October, just like Microsoft will do their “H1” and “H2” releases for the first and second half of the year. You still get updates in between, but those updates are for the packages and programs on top of the base OS, not anything core to the OS itself. This means that if a core component of the OS gets a new feature, any developer that wants to use that feature can’t update until the next major OS release. This release methodology increases the stability of the OS, but also means that at worst your packages may be six months out of date. It also introduces the risk of a version upgrade breaking things because so much is changing at once and maybe not all of the programs you use or their dependencies are ready for the jump when you do the upgrade. A rolling release, on the other hand, is meant to basically be always up to date. Every time a package, core or not, gets an update, you can apply it. It means that every time you update, something might break, but in actual use it means developers can keep their programs up to date and using the latest features as much as possible. Just make sure you update at least once every couple weeks or you might find that the system refuses to update or something else breaks. Arch, OpenSuse Tumbleweed and distributions based on them are rolling releases. Linux Mint, Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian are all periodic releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may have heard of an Atomic OS or an Immutable OS. These distributions use layers of abstraction to make the core of the OS completely unchangeable by the end user. This is how Mac OS is built these days. Every install is exactly identical on the system level as long as it’s using the same OS image. This is nice because users can’t destroy their install nearly as easily and backing up or restoring the OS is trivial. The downside is that some changes that a user might want to make become more difficult and will be wiped out with new updates because the core of the OS is completely overwritten when a new version is installed. Fedora Silverblue, Bazzite, and Steam Deck OS all work this way. Most other distributions don’t. I like to get under the hood, so I avoided these for my main computer, but my home theater PC doesn’t need to be as customized, so I put Bazzite on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, after looking at all of those aspects, do a little bit of research into the intention and ideology of the team making the distributions you are considering. Read the websites, try to get a feel for what they want their OS to do. What is important to them. Compare that against what you want to do or are interested in. For example, this blurb is on the EndeavourOS home page: “Start your Endeavour with a lightweight Arch-based, terminal centric system ready to personalise and a stellar community at your side.”  It tells you right away that if you aren’t interested in a system that is built to rely on the terminal for core functions, you should stay away. Likewise, if you are looking for a strong community for support, this might be a good spot for you. Compare this to Linux Mint: “Linux Mint is an operating system for desktop and laptop computers. It is designed to work &amp;lsquo;out of the box&amp;rsquo; and comes fully equipped with the apps most people need.” They’re focusing on making things work with little configuration and are touting the idea that the OS comes with a bunch of software already installed. This might be a better OS for you if you just want to pick up and go without worrying much about configuring the system or dealing with the terminal, but on the other hand, maybe they’ve made some decisions about what software “most people need” that you won’t agree with, so you’ll have to go searching for alternatives or spend time removing junk you don’t want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s one final thing to mention before we close; the Desktop Environment. if the Linux kernel is the core and the Distribution is the layer of core packages around that core, the desktop environment is the top layer of applications the user will be interacting with every time they use the computer. Sure, this means the browser or word processor, but also the file manager and general desktop. Unfortunately, there’s not a ton of guidance I can give here other than telling you to look at the screenshots of the various flavors of desktop environment available for the distribution you choose. Usually the big names are the most well documented and reliable. The two giants in this category are GNOME and KDE Plasma. Both of which are available on a huge number of distributions. Others, like XFCE, Cinnamon or Mate, are usually pretty good, but maybe a little less well supported with customizations. There is, however, a different category of desktop environment available. The Window Manager. These are basically the desktop environment alone with no bells or whistles. Some won’t even come with a taskbar by default. Naturally, these are much more difficult and time consuming to configure, but it also means that the configuration is usually portable between computers and there are a lot more options to set things up exactly how you like. Window managers include Sway, i3 and Hyprland, among others. If you’re new to Linux, I suggest sticking with the standard Desktop Environment options, rather than going for a window manager. If you’re interested in a more in-depth exploration of my window manager of choice, Hyprland, then watch this space. I’ll get to it sooner or later in this series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope all of this is helpful to someone. Linux is a hard thing to build recommendations for, since the experience of using a Linux desktop can be so varied. Next time, we’ll explore Hyprland and how I’ve got my desktop set up with a tiling window manager for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Embracing Open Source Part 1: Ideology and Background</title>
      <link>/posts/2025-04-30-eos1/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/posts/2025-04-30-eos1/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post is the start of a series I’ve been wanting to write for a long time. I want to chronicle my journey with Linux, Free and Open Source Software, and taking back control over my data and my devices. If there’s a topic you are particularly interested in reading about in a future installment, please feel free to &lt;a href=&#34;/pages/contact/&#34;&gt;send me a message&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been nearly twenty years since I got a PC that was mine and mine alone. It was a laptop, a Dell XPS Studio 1640. It was huge, thick and heavy with a bright red top and a leather strip on the lower part of the screen’s back. I loved that thing. It was 2009 and most of the corporations that are in the news now for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theverge.com/news/650665/google-loses-ad-tech-antitrust-monopoly-lawsuit&#34;&gt;anti competitive practices&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/heres-why-states-are-suing-meta-for-hurting-teens-with-facebook-and-instagram/&#34;&gt;harming teens&lt;/a&gt; were on the upswing. It was a golden age of free software that — because the companies involved were raising venture capital funding — was more focused on gaining users than anything else. Windows was still an operating system you paid for, and Adobe Creative Cloud was still four years away. We were starting to move towards the enshittification hole, but we hadn’t tipped over the edge quite yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was around the same time that I first heard of Linux, an alternative operating system to the commercial juggernauts Apple and Microsoft were peddling. I even tried Linux, booting into an Ubuntu 10.04 live CD on my red leather laptop. It was an interesting experiment, but Linux wasn’t ready for me yet, and more importantly, I wasn’t ready for Linux yet. Even with the release of the poorly received Windows 8, I went back to Microsoft, to what was comfortable and familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I heard more and more about how Linux was “good now” or that every year was “the year of Linux on the desktop.” Now a meme, these insistent claims felt like a form of denial at the time. I tried Linux again in 2018 or so, several years after valve released the first version of SteamOS, an Ubuntu-based Linux distribution with Steam preinstalled and right around the time that Valve released the first versions of their Proton compatibility layer. It felt a bit better in some ways, but still I found myself returning to Windows a month or so later. It wasn’t until the fall of 2023 that I made the switch again. This time, it stuck. I ran &lt;a href=&#34;https://manjaro.org/&#34;&gt;Manjaro&lt;/a&gt; for a little over a year, learned a lot about Linux and rolling release distributions, and switched to &lt;a href=&#34;https://endeavouros.com/&#34;&gt;EndeavourOS&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, you may be asking, where’s the ideology the post title promised me? Trust me, dear reader, it’s coming. Right now, in fact. I gave you my background first to establish my position. I’m a fairly recent full convert to Linux generally speaking, though I’ve enjoyed the fruits of FOSS projects for decades, most commonly in the video game emulation space. I’m no coder or contributor, I am far from a terminal wizard, and I am constantly looking up ways to make my computer work the way I want it to. So why the effort? Why not just go with the herd, install Windows 11, and use a computer that has wider support because it’s the default? I break down my reasoning like this. I want my data to be mine. I want my data to be portable. I want my data to be private, and I want my computers to do what I want the way I want it to. If I can get all that and also not have to worry about developers abandoning or shutting down software I’m using, I think I can be a lot happier in my technology life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do I mean by wanting my data to be mine? Let’s look at an example. I have an Android phone. My phone comes with an app for taking notes. Because it’s Android, those notes live in Google Keep, a web service run by Google that synchronizes your notes to the cloud, allows you to share them with others, and collaborate on them. All useful features to be sure, but who owns those notes? They don’t even exist on my phone. They’re on a web server somewhere controlled by a corporation that has so many fingers into the proverbial information pie that the pie is more fingers than filling at this point. If google decides to kill Keep like they have with &lt;a href=&#34;https://killedbygoogle.com/&#34;&gt;so many other services&lt;/a&gt;, those notes are just… gone and I’ll need to find a new way to take and share notes. In this way, my notes aren’t mine. Whether they survive or not is just up to someone else. The same can be said of music, movies, video games, calendars, instant messaging, search, online file storage, and so many more types of data. I want to claw back whatever I can, even if it means investing time and energy into providing those things for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding on to the previous point, I want my data to be portable. Yes, that means being able to export my information and take it with me, but more importantly, that means being able to continue to interact with that data outside its original context. If my note taking app of choice shuts down, I want the notes to be in an easily readable and standard format so that I can read them with any number of alternate programs. I want my movies to work outside of whatever digital store I purchase them from. I want my music to be available offline indefinitely. In fact, I want all of my stuff to be available whether I can connect to the internet or not. Similarly, I want any internet availability of my data to be based on my own terms. I want to host it myself, which means I’m also a much smaller target for hacks or data breaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if my data is available offline, is not tied into a corporate service, and is portable and readable in standard formats, then that naturally leads to data privacy. I know I can’t escape the eye of corporate tech giants completely, but reducing my footprint where I can is something I want to strive for. I will admit that privacy is somewhat less of a concern for me compared to the other points, but it is a nice benefit to have as I address the other issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last point is mostly about Linux. At first, I just wanted to get away from Microsoft insisting that Windows must have an online account, but over time I realized that in almost every instance, if my computer didn’t do the thing I wanted it to, it was easy to change that behavior in Linux. Mostly through the way that Linux applications tend to handle settings. While I still believe that most mainstream computer users should not be expected to edit text configuration files to change settings, I cannot deny that the flexibility and portability of text files is really great. For example, I can reinstall my entire operating system with the applications I use, then just drop my configuration files in my home folder and be right back to the configuration I had. Linux best practices are also beneficial in helping me ensure a computer does what I want. For example, programs are intended to output data in such a way as to make that data easy to ingest with another program. The example folks who are newer to Linux will still probably recognize involves &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt;, which is a program for getting data from the internet via URL. So you might have a command that looks like this: &lt;code&gt;curl http://server/script.sh | bash&lt;/code&gt;. This command uses &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; to pull a script from a server, then immediately pipes, or sends that output to &lt;code&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt; which will execute the script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I move forward in my Linux journey, I will keep coming back to these four major principles. My ideal is to have as much of what I use day to day covered by them as I can. I’ve already done a lot of this work, so keep an eye out for the next installment in this series where I go over how to pick a Linux distribution and get started with it in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tool Recommendations</title>
      <link>/posts/2025-04-12-tools/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 12 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/posts/2025-04-12-tools/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every home should have a well stocked toolbox. From dorms to single family dwellings, everyone should have some basic tools to take care of emergency maintenance tasks. I&amp;rsquo;ve outlined below a few toolboxes that are ideal to serve each type of home. These lists are by no means exhaustive or apply to every situation. These are just my recommendations. These lists are also additive. Each list assumes that you already have the tools in the previous list. After the tool lists, there are two bonus lists. One is for additional items that will make things easier or faster. The other is for consumables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A note on tool pricing and what to buy: In the vast majority of cases, you should get the cheapest possible version of a tool you can. In the US, you will find that Harbor Freight has a lot of extremely cheap tools. Some of these are good, some are very much not worth it. Some can be adapted or modified to make them better. Harbor freight has a really robust tool reviewing community on YouTube. If you are unsure, it&amp;rsquo;s likely a good idea to look up some impressions. If you use a tool enough to break it, then consider upgrading to a nicer version of the same tool depending on how fast it breaks. If you break a screwdriver after ten years, maybe just buy the same screwdriver again, for example. Similarly, keep an eye on the conditions of your tools. A worn out Philips screwdriver will almost always cause more harm than good. Replace tools that are worn out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;minimal&#34;&gt;Minimal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tools are the bare minimum I consider to be essential for any person living on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tool box or bag – Always always have a home for your tools. Ideally this will be big enough for everything on the list, plus some room for expansion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hammer – Any framing hammer will do. It should have a claw on the back for pulling nails and a flat head on the other side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;#2 phillips screwdriver – Get one with a long shank (see Fig. 1) to fit into deep holes. #2 phillips is the most common screwdriver head you will likely find in the US. In Canada, you might want to add a Robinson screwdriver.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flathead screwdriver – Get a 1/4&amp;quot; wide one to start. This will fit most slotted screws you will come across. In a pinch, a flathead screwdriver is a good wedge or pry bar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Angled pliers – Also called channel locks. These pliers are at an angle to give you a little more mechanical advantage when turning bolts. The channels mean they are significantly more adjustable than standard pliers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adjustable wrench – Sometimes also called a Crescent Wrench or a Monkey Wrench. These wrenches have a worm gear in the head that moves one of the jaws closer or further away. A small one is fine to start. This, plus your channel locks, will give you the tools you need to do most basic plumbing repair.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/screwdriver-anatomy.png&#34; alt=&#34;Fig. 1: screwdriver anatomy&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;apartmentcondo&#34;&gt;Apartment/Condo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While apartment maintenance people are available to fix basically anything you need them to, sometimes they can be backed up and whatever your repair is may not be high enough priority for them to get to you right away. You can make your apartment life a lot easier with a slight upgrade to the basic tool kit above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magnetic Stud Finder – These little guys are extremely cheap. They find studs by magetizing onto the drywall screws used to affix the drywall to your walls. If you&amp;rsquo;re hanging anything heavier than wall art, screw directly into the studs. Just find a stud with your magnet, then put your screw in a couple inches up or down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outlet Tester – Also a cheap tool that can be invaluable. You plug it into an outlet and it lights up to tell you if the outlet is working or not. It has a little bit of circuitry inside to diagnose common problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8/9/10/11-in-1 screwdriver – These screwdrivers have a wider variety of bits for unusual screw sizes, plus a couple common socket sizes for hex bolts. When I did apartment maintenance, this driver was my work horse. Look for one in a similar style to Fig. 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 (or more) in-1 Paint knife – These cheap paint/putty knives have tools for opening paint cans, spreading spackle, cutting seam lines, and cleaning paint rollers. Don&amp;rsquo;t bother buying a single use putty knife when one with more function is the same price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bright flashlight – Sometimes the lights go out, it happens. Having a nice, bright flashlight is important. A cell phone would work for this in a pinch, but having something dedicated that you always know the location of is useful. Especially if that light can be clipped onto a hat, strapped onto your head, or even held in your mouth as you do work in the dark.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/11-in-1-driver.png&#34; alt=&#34;Fig. 2: 11-in-1 Screwdriver&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;detached-home&#34;&gt;Detached Home&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations! You&amp;rsquo;re in a single family home and now you have to contend with all of the stress and work that entails! Most of these tools are about getting things juuust right or doing more involved repairs yourself, since you&amp;rsquo;re more likely to be in this kind of home for much longer than an apartment or similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Measuring Tape – You know them, you love them. Get one of the silver metal ones. They are nearly indestructible compared to their plastic cousins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bubble Level – They&amp;rsquo;re cheap, they&amp;rsquo;re simple, and they work. Get one and use it anytime you hang anything on the wall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speed Square – Good for ensuring things are at right angles (or common other angles) to each other, has the bonus benefit of being able to carry lines between walls if you want things to be the same height around a corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Straight Edge/Ruler – You never know when you&amp;rsquo;re going to need a straight line. Your bubble level may be able to double as a nice straight edge as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pipe Wrench – Confusingly, also sometimes called a monkey wrench. These wrenches are designed to bite into smooth, round surfaces and have a long handle to ensure you have a good mechanical advantage. You won&amp;rsquo;t use it often, but when you do, you&amp;rsquo;ll be glad you had it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standard and Metric Hex Keys – Also called Allen keys or Allen wrenches. These are the things that Ikea gives out for free. There&amp;rsquo;s a wide variety of sizes in both metric and standard, so having a set of each is important if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to strip out the screws.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Torx Wrenches – A set of torx wrenches is cheap and this style of screw is getting more and more popular. They don&amp;rsquo;t slip or strip out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standard and Metric Box End Wrenches – Sometimes your adjustable wrench will just be too big to fit into a space. Having a complete set of box end wrenches is nice for that eventuality. If you are feeling fancy, wrenches with ratchets in the round end are nice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standard and Metric socket sets – Sometimes you can only get to a screw from directly above it. That&amp;rsquo;s where sockets come in. You don&amp;rsquo;t need huge sets of each, just get small kits with common sizes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drywall saw – A saw that can cut into a wall is nice to have and inexpensive. Drywall saws are specific in that they have a pointed end, good for starting a cut.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Needle Nosed Pliers – useful for fishing things out of drains or clearing hair out of some more modern drain designs. Get a pair that are very long and narrow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diagonal Cutters – We do not use the slang for these. Don&amp;rsquo;t ask. They look like pliers, but have a cutting edge. Most cut from both sides at once. A good set of diagonal cutters can be wire strippers, wire cutters, and even trimmers for plants in a pinch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additional Flathead Screwdrivers, Additional Adjustable Wrench – A wider variety of these tools is useful in some circumstances, but not always required. If you followed the previous lists already, I would get a long handled flathead (12&amp;quot; shank) a wider flathead (3/8&amp;quot; or 1/2&amp;quot;) and a longer adjustable wrench (12&amp;quot;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;upgrades&#34;&gt;Upgrades&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are tools to buy as you feel you want them to save time, effort, or expand your repair possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Power Drill and Impact Driver – A battery powered drill and driver set is not very expensive as far as power tools go and can be combined with a good set of bits to make any screwing task exceptionally faster and easier. Save money and get the impact driver first. You can get drill bits compatible with them and they&amp;rsquo;ll be significantly better at driving screws.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Note on Power Tools – It is very likely that whatever power tool brand you buy into first will be the one your stick with, since the batteries are interchangeable. For this reason, I recommend Makita, Miluakee, and DeWalt. Ryobi has a huge variety of tools, but I have had some very bad experiences with Ryobi tools letting go of bits, sometimes in a very dangerous manner. Similar complaints can be leveled at the various home center house brands, Rigid and Kobalt. A dedicated tool maker and reputable brand is the way to go here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nylon Deadblow Mallet – A deadblow mallet has metal ball bearings inside the head. As you land a swing, all of those pellets move from one side of the mallet to the other, preventing the mallet from bouncing back at you and ensure more fo the force from the swing goes into whatever you are hitting. A nylon head will prevent the mallet from marking whatever you&amp;rsquo;re hitting as much.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multimeter – One of those &amp;ldquo;you don&amp;rsquo;t need it until you do&amp;rdquo; style tools. A multimeter will detect AC or DC voltage, resistance, and continuity. Useful when dealing with battery backup systems, troubleshooting power tool batteries, or doing electronics projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Headlamp – The big upgrade to a flashlight is a flashlight that you don&amp;rsquo;t need hands to use. They look goofy, but are dead useful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Precision Screwdriver Set – Useful for fixing electronics, taking apart toys to fix them, or doing any other small work. I like the ifixit Mako set.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infrared Thermometer – An invaluable tool for HVAC or refrigeration diagnosis. Point it at a vent and pull the trigger. If your AC is working, the air coming through will be very cold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Electric stud finder – These tools will tell you not only where the studs are, but also when you&amp;rsquo;re aimed at the center of them, if there are any electric lines nearby, and sometimes even if there are water pipes you are at risk of rupturing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Laser Level – Uses a compass and accelerometer to determine what is flat, then projects a laser along that line on the wall. Extremely useful for ensuring multiple items are exactly the right height on walls and significantly more foolproof than a bubble level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;consumables&#34;&gt;Consumables&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stuff that&amp;rsquo;s useful to have on hand. Generally speaking, buy these in bulk rather than as a couple of individual pieces. It&amp;rsquo;s not much more expensive to do so and will save you a lot of time in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 1/2&amp;quot; Wood Screws (I recommend torx head) – Wood screws only have threads closer to the tip. The benefit here is that they can pull two pieces of wood together with some clamping force better than other screws.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 1/2&amp;quot; Drywall Screws – These phillips head screws are cheap and abundant. Good for hanging light decorations or doing drywall repair.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3&amp;quot; drywall screws – These are ideal for digging into studs for mounting heavier decorations like shelves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drywall Anchors – Get the metal big screw kind (Fig. 3.) Anytime you hang anything on a wall, either drill into a stud, or use an anchor. Your curtain rods and photos will never fall off the wall with these guys.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Picture Nails – If you don&amp;rsquo;t want to dig a big hole into the wall with an anchor, nails are cheap. I don&amp;rsquo;t personally recommend them, but hey, you do you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Painter&amp;rsquo;s Tape – Blue (or green) masking tape. Good for getting clean lines when painting. Just remember to pull the tape before the paint fully dries!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Electrical Tape – Use this any time you need to wrap up a wire. Electrical tape is waterproof from the non-sticky side, but shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be used as a water seal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Duct Tape – The old standby. Get whatever color you want. This stuff is dead useful for temporary fixes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teflon Tape – Use this or pipe dope on any plumbing connection you make, but not both! Teflon tape is significantly less messy. Just make sure you wrap it with the threads, not against them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rug Tape – A great way to keep rugs stuck down to wood floors. Use some of this at each corner if your rugs slide around too much.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loctite (blue) – If you ever have screws that like to back themselves out due to vibration, thread locking fluid will help them stay put. The blue varietty is meant to be removable if you ever need to. The red kind will permanently affix whatever you use it on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scotch Brite or 220-grit sandpaper – Useful for cleaning up pipes when making new connections, can also be used to sand down spackle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/drywall-anchor.png&#34; alt=&#34;Fig. 3: Drywall and stud anchors.&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-not-to-keep-on-hand&#34;&gt;What not to keep on hand&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some stuff just isn’t worth buying a lot of or keeping on hand. Things dry out or become unusable over time, so it’s better to just buy some when you need it. Stuff like spackle, caulk, and silicone sealant are in this category. Just buy enough to complete your current job and toss the leftovers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stardew Valley 1.6 and Returning to the Simple Life</title>
      <link>/posts/2024-05-03-stardew/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/posts/2024-05-03-stardew/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post is for 2024’s WeblogPoMo2024, a challenge to post every day in May. While I cannot commit to being able to write something every day, I will try to post something every week in May.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately I’ve been playing a lot of Stardew Valley’s 1.6 update. I absolutely adored the game when it originally released. It was the first ever game in the farming/life sim genre that I really stuck with for any significant length of time. I never really felt a pull to stick to it longterm, though and eventually fell off. I don’t really have forever games as much as games I come back to on a semiregular basis. Stardew has had two revisitations from me. The first one was when multiplayer was new. The second one was a couple years ago. While I enjoyed my time with the game both of those times, I never even completed the base game’s content again to get to the “new” stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, I feel a much greater sense of momentum, not only because of the promise of new stuff at the end of the road, but also some very thoughtful changes to the early and midgame parts of Stardew Valley. Perhaps the biggest of these changes is the alteration to the game’s economy. Nothing has been particularly rebalanced in terms of the various methods of making money. Rather, there are just a lot more things to spend that money on now. At launch, Stardew Valley felt balanced around two years of ingame play, with the possibility of completing everything in one if you knew ahead of time what to plant or fish for. Now, the game feels balanced for maybe three or five years of ingame play not counting the Perfection completion. There’s a lot more to spend money on. There are new options to randomize required items for the community center bundles, and there’s more reason to play through many years of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find this rebalancing act to be very interesting as a concept. Like the game was intended for one type of player at first, then a bunch of stuff was added to the end of that experience over time. Now there’s more runway to get to that same end-game style content, but also it makes that curve a lot smoother. It feels like an appropriate change to a game intended to be more comfortable and anti-stressful, but it does also mirror some late-game updates to other indie titles. One of the ones that most readily jumps to mind is Terraria’s Journey’s End update, which added a huge amount of content to make playing and replaying the game more interesting and ensmoothen the path to endgame content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I don’t really have much to say about it at this point. I’m still working towards the “new endgame” so to speak, so I don’t really have a complete formulation in my head yet, but I am thoroughly enjoying myself and encourage lapsed Stardew Valley fans to go back and enjoy the game again.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tea, A Crash Course</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every once in a while, folks I know will reach out to me asking for recommendations for this, that, or the other with regards to tea. While coffee lovers are a dime a dozen, especially in the US, the tea-loving community tends to be much smaller, though I have also found tea lovers to be a lot more interested in sharing their passion, rather than gatekeeping others. In that spirit, I want to put basically all of my tea knowledge down to paper, as it were, in order to share the love that I have for the breadth and depth of what at first appears to be a remarkably simple beverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we begin, however, I need to impress upon you, dear reader, that I am not the be-all or end-all of tea knowledge or any sort of a taste-maker. I am not some refined palate who can pick apart all of the component flavors in a cup. I simply like what I like and enjoy trying different things enough to make a few recommendations. I also am not, and never have been, a coffee drinker, so I don’t have specific advice for the lover of tea’s sister-beverage. I’m also coming at this from the perspective of an American so my resources may not be as helpful, though I do hope that they can begin to point anyone in the direction of a good cup of tea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, where should we start? I could expound upon specific distributors, growing locations, brewing methods, or equipment, but I think we should start where it is always best to start. At first principles. What is tea? At its most basic level, tea is a beverage brewed with leaves from Camelia Sinensis, or the tea plant. Tea grows in southeast Asia and India, with two major varietals, C. Sinensis var Sinensis and C. Sinensis var Assamica. There’s a couple other varietals, but these are the major two you will see. Like many other types of plant, the location and conditions for growth and processing can drastically change the flavors found in tea, which we will explore soon. For now, it is worth knowing that in this article, if I am talking about tea, then I am talking about tea made from Camelia Sinensis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tea plant is typically farmed in long rows. They look mostly like little shrubs, which is exactly what tea is. Farmers will trim the shrubs, plucking tea leaves from them. This is typically done twice a year in spring or early summer. While some larger industrial operations will use machines to speed up the process, smaller farms or farms focused on the highest quality product will do this process by hand. Once the leaves are plucked, they are wilted for around 12 hours. The wilting process is often done overnight. During this time, the leaves will lose a third of their moisture content and begin to oxidize. Once this has happened, the leaves will be torn or bruised to speed up the enzymatic oxidation process. Once the leaves have reached the desired oxidization level. Generally speaking, lighter teas will be oxidized less than darker teas. That’s why lighter teas, like white and green teas taste more vegetal or grassy, while black teas taste more bitter and malty. Once the tea leaves have reached the ideal oxidization, they will be lightly heated to denature the enzymes. This is known as kill-green or fixation. With this done, the tea can be rolled. This is sometimes done by hand, but can also be done by machine. The rolled leaves are then dried, causing them to become brittle and shelf-stable. From here, they can either be pulverized and bagged for teabags, or packaged up for sale as loose leaf tea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;okay-so-what-should-i-drink&#34;&gt;Okay, so what should I drink?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a good question! The first thing you should do, as with any new endeavor, is try a variety of things to see what you like! Earlier, I said that I would only be talking about Camelia Sinensis teas here, but that’s because that’s what I like. Sure there’s a lot of variety within that category, but there’s also whole other categories of “tea” that aren’t technically “tea” like Yerba Mate, Rooibos, and Herbal Teas. I’ll touch on those at the end of the article, but let’s get back on topic here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever had any tea in your life, it has probably been a black tea and of all black teas, there are a few that show up again and again. The first is English Breakfast. This tea is a black tea that is known to be very strong in flavor, with lots of bitter tannins. English breakfast is typically a blend of teas made from the Darjeeling and Assam areas of India. The other common tea, as loved famously by Captain Jean-Luc Picard from Star Trek: The Next Generation, is Earl Grey. Earl grey is a black tea that is combined with bergamot oil or peels. These bitter oranges give the tea a distinct flavor and aroma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll confess. I don’t particularly like either of these teas. The Darjeeling style tea especially tastes significantly more bitter and less rich than the Assam-forward teas I like to drink. A common Assam-forward tea is Lipton. Yep, as it turns out, I like the taste of the very cheap plain default black teabags in America when compared to many fancy Brittish teas simply because Lipton uses more Assam tea in their blend. Outside of those three common black teas, you can find some other styles. Your local Asian grocery store might have some smoked black teas. These acrid teas might pique your interest if you enjoy smoked barbecue or mezcal. You also might find Irish breakfast, which tends to be a blend that is much heavier on the Assam tea than its English counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next to these, you will probably find green teas. These are much more grassy in flavor and are lighter. They’re less bitter and tend to blend better with other flavors, which is why many pre-bottled green teas are bolstered with artificial fruit flavors. Green teas also tend to come in Chinese and Japanese styles. Chinese greens tend to have a little bit more oxidization, while Japanese green teas come in several flavors all on their own, from the bright and extra-grassy sencha to the earthy and bitter matcha to the unusual popcorn-like taste of genmaicha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes in the grocery store, you might also see oolong teas. Oolong is kind of like a bridge between green and black teas, with more of the tannins and malty notes from black teas while retaining some of the slightly more vegetal qualities of green teas. The combination can make them taste almost nutty in flavor. That said, the variety in oolong teas is extremely wide, with various regions making unique varieties that taste unlike any others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As tea has grown in popularity, white teas have also started appearing. Extremely light, these teas are delicate and floral, with almost no oxidization at all and an airy quality. The light oxidization also means they’re less overly bitter than black teas, but they don’t share the extreme vegetal taste as green teas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s two more categories of tea that I cannot speak to at all. Pu’erh tea is fermented, pressed into bricks and left to age. Its flavor is often described as earthy or dirt-like. Yellow tea is the other one, this tea is cooked green tea that loses some of its green color as the chlorophyl in it decays. It’s not as oxidized as oolong or black teas, but it loses some of the vegetal notes due to the yellowing process. It’s also notably not roasted. When yellow tea is cooked, it’s held around 100 degrees F.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re just starting out, I’d recommend getting one box each of English breakfast, green, and one of the mass market teas, like PG tips or Lipton. If you’re feeling adventurous and can find some, try Earl Grey, Oolong, and white tea too. The brands here don’t matter a ton. The big thing you’re trying to do is figure out what you like out of the major categories. Think of it like trying apples, oranges, and leafy greens. There’s major differences between varieties of apples, citrus fruit, and leafy greens, but knowing which categories you want to explore further can help you build a vocabulary to look for your next exploratory purchase. There’s another section down below with recommendations on specific places to go get tea once you have that vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;okay-i-have-some-teabags-now-what&#34;&gt;Okay, I have some teabags. Now what?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great! This section is really straightforward, I promise. Now that you have tea, it’s time to make it! Each box should have brewing instructions, but there’s also a basic set of rules for brewing tea. It’s really easy. First, do not boil your tea. Always pour your hot water over your teabag or tea leaves in another heat-safe mug or teapot. If you maintain a boiling temperature while brewing the tea, it will come out tasting burned and bitter. Second, don’t leave the tea in the mug after the brew time is over. The longer tea steeps, the more stuff leeches into the water. The good flavors come into the water in the first couple minutes. By the fourth or fifth minute, you’re just getting nasty extra-bitter flavors. Thirdly, don’t let your tea sit too long, even after you take out the leaves or bag. Tea leaves and teabags contain a lot of tea dust that continues to strengthen and change the tea flavors after you remove the bulk of the leaves. While this doesn’t make your tea turn immediately, it can give the tea off flavors if it sits for a few hours. Generally speaking if it gets so cold you want to reheat it, you might as well dump it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people across the world drink tea completely without adornment, but I’ve found that a splash of whole milk and a little sugar go a long way toward my personal enjoyment. I like sweet things, so the sugar is a given, but the milk does a lot to reduce the drying effect the tannins have on my palate and taking the edge off of the bitterness. This is especially true in black teas. Tea is a lighter, less bold flavor than coffee, though, so if you’re a big latte drinker, maybe start with less milk and if you normally use half and half or cream in coffee, maybe downgrade to milk instead. Any sweetener you like is fine, and any non-dairy milk is fine as well, just experiment a bit to figure out what you like best! Just don’t pour your milk into your mug before the boiling water. Douglas Adams was definitely wrong on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as equipment is concerned, there’s a lot of misinformation out there. First of all, the microwave is totally fine for heating water. You just want to be exceptionally careful. If you heat your water too much, then disturb it, it can flash-boil causing burns. You can also absolutely use a pot to boil water on your stove or hot-plate. Just be careful when you pour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good first upgrade for a new tea lover is a good kettle. You can get one to heat on your stove top, but a much better option is to use an electric one. It plugs into the wall and heats the water directly inside the kettle with electricity. A common misconception here is that electric kettles are slow in North America where our mains voltage is only 120 volts. While it’s true that a kettle in many European countries with 240-volt power will boil water faster, a 120-volt kettle is still much faster than a stove top kettle. Mine even boils faster than a pan on the “rapid boil” 240v burner on the stove with the same volume of water. IF you’re concerned about plastic touching your boiling water, all-stainless steel models do exist and are relatively affordable. If you like green, white, or oolong teas, I recommend getting a variable-temperature one so you can set a specific temperature to brew at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;that-was-tasty-i-want-more&#34;&gt;That was tasty! I want &lt;strong&gt;MORE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excellent news! There’s loads of places to get excellent tea these days. The biggest tea upgrade you can make after investing in a good kettle is upgrading the quality of the leaves you’re using. Teabags, even the fancy pyramid ones, use tea that has been crushed and broken up so much that the tea brews very quickly and it’s difficult to dial in that perfect level of flavor. The quality of leaves in teabags is also often just not quite as good. That’s where loose leaf tea comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loose leaf teas might need some special brewing practices. For example, it’s a good idea to rinse your leaves with boiled water once right before brewing them. Basically pour enough water to cover them, then dump out the water before brewing them normally. This washes away some of the smaller particles and dust that you don’t want to keep in your cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matcha is powdered, so it requires a little bit of a unique process as well. Sift your matcha into a bowl or mug, then add water. Mix it vigorously to build a foamy head at the top. A milk frother is a good shortcut, but don’t overdo it. The more agitation you do, the faster it will brew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first major recommendation with regards to loose leaf tea is to support local businesses as much as you can, especially if they have good relationships with tea farmers that they work directly with and aren’t just repackaging and reselling bulk tea that they are buying from other sellers. These shops can be useful for trying a lot of varieties quickly, but aren’t always forthcoming with their sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that comes specialty grocery stores. These sometimes directly import tea from other parts of the world that are harder to find locally. Asian grocers often have sizeable selections. Some stuff to look out for in this category are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ito-en Sencha - Ito-en is basically the default green tea supplier in Japan. A huge amount of green tea you find in japanese vending machines is Ito-en, but they also sell teabags and loose teas internationally. The loose sencha is quite good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maeda-en Matcha - The more expensive the can, the better the matcha will be. One of the few things in tea where the price per cup of the finished product is tied directly to how good that cup is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yama Moto Yama green tea bags - Also a japanese green tea, this time in bags. Not quite as common as Ito-en stuff, but I like these teabags better than Ito-en’s teabags&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can’t find a specialy store with tea to try, your local grocer might have some variety. Try anythign that catches your eye. Even if it’s the same style of tea, diffrerent brands do things slightly differently, so it’s worth experimenting to find what you like. Some stuff to get your started:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celestial Seasonings Green Tea - The basic Celestial Seasonings green tea is actually extremely good. While Celestial Seasonings specializes in herbal teas that are, strictly speaking, not tea, they do have some good stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lipton tea - Yep, the super cheap boxes of 100 teabags that are my most commonly drunk tea are these bad boys. The decaf tastes weird. Don’t bother.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twinnings Irish Breakfast - A more assam-heavy variety of English BReakfast, this tea is strong and malty and tastes even better with milk in it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bewley’s Irish Breakfast - A tea I haven’t ever found in the US, but is like the Twinings Irish breakfast, but better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PG Tips - A tea I know more by reputation than anything else. The only one in the entire article I name but haven’t yet tried, but the recommendation is so ubiquitous, that I figure it’s worth giving a try.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bigelow Constant Comment - an earl grey adjacent blend with black tea, orange rind, and sweet spices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Chinese teas of all kinds, my favorite source is Yunnan Sourcing. There’s a &lt;a href=&#34;https://yunnansourcing.com/&#34;&gt;global site&lt;/a&gt;, where orders ship directly from China. They create and maintain relationships directly with farmers and are very reasonably priced. They also maintain a US warehouse and separate &lt;a href=&#34;https://yunnansourcing.us/&#34;&gt;US site&lt;/a&gt; for domestic orders. The US site naturally has faster shipping, but the chinese site sometimes has a wider selection. Some of my favorites from this seller are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yunnan “Black Gold Bi Luo Chun” Black Tea - Yunnan Sourcing’s best seller and work horse, an excellent black tea with a strong assam flavor profile and a pleasing gold color. This is one that basically lands in my cart every time I make an order because of how reliably excellent it is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Honey Orchid “Mi Lan Xiang” Dan Cong Oolong Tea - My wife’s current favorite, floral and nutty, with a slightly matly aftertaste. Goes well with milk and honey.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Premium Grade Dragon Well Tea From Zhejiang Long Jing Tea - My favorite chinese style green tea. This one is a little bit darker and fuller-bodied than the japanese green teas, but still with a light, grassy flavor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feng Qing Classic 58 Dian Hong Premium Yunnan Black Tea - My runner up for best black loose leaf tea from this seller. A rich, full flavor that is moderated slightly with some floral notes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also had good luck with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://beautifultaiwantea.com/&#34;&gt;Beautiful Taiwan Tea Company&lt;/a&gt; Some stuff I’ve liked from here has been&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Red Jade Black Tea - Like the Black Gold, but even better. It brews to a bright red color and tastes incredible, malty and thick, like it’s coating your throat. Even better with milk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Formosa Assam Black Tea - My runner up to the Black Jade. Sits somewhere bretween the Classic 58 from Yunnan Sourcing and the Black Gold from them. Has a slightly fruity flavor to it when you add sugar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yushan High Mountain Oolong - Nutty and malty, with a strong savory flavor. Definitely a fun tea to try to see how different an oolong can be from green and black teas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Four Seasons Oolong - A little dusty, since it’s picked with a machine, but reasonably priced and easy to brew. Has a vegetal flavor, but stays away from the overwhelmingly grassy notes of green teas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For japanese tea, I find it hard to go wrong with anything sold by &lt;a href=&#34;https://ippodotea.com/&#34;&gt;Ippodo&lt;/a&gt;. It can be a little pricey, but they ship worldwide and the quality is very high. Recommendations here are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ummon matcha - A full, earthy, savory tea with very little in the way of grass flavor. Brews a deep dark green. Add a little sugar and it’s accessible to basically anyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hosen Sencha - a light, fragrant tea with less astringency on the aftertaste. A great one to start with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kaboku Sencha - a green tea that tastes almost sweet all on its own, with floral flavors and a fresh-cut-grass scent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kanro Gyokuro - A slightly sweet and savory green tea, with a complex flavor. The manufacturer also recommend brewing it cold for a different experience, which is unusual in tea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;okay-so-the-tea-is-good-but-my-mugs-are-lackluster&#34;&gt;Okay, so the tea is good, but my mugs are lackluster…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the secret true reason to love tea: The teaware! You can find amazing teaware everywhere, from the asian grocers I mentioned in the last section, to the online tea sellers, to specialty shops that only exist to sell you another teapot, even though you already have four and this one is too small to really be useful anyway, but it’s so damn cute. I don’t have a problem. You have a problem. That problem is you don’t have enough teaware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple notes, though. Due to the international love of tea, most capacities for teaware will be labeled in mililiters. It’s worth looking up how much that is in your local units so you can get an idea. I absolutely have a teeny tiny 120ml teapot that is barely big enough to do anything with because I didn’t read the description well enough. Here’s some fun things to look at&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ippodo’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://ippodotea.com/collections/utensils/products/yakishime-kyusu&#34;&gt;Yakishime Kyusu&lt;/a&gt; - An 8-oz teapot in the kyusu style. Kyusu have a handle perpendicular to the poouring spout and are meant to be poured completely one-handed. The hollow handle ensures the pot stays cool while you handle it, even if it’s full of deliciously hot tea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forlife’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.forlifedesignusa.com/collections/all-products/products/brew-in-mug-extra-fine-tea-infuser-with-lid-single-pack&#34;&gt;Extra-fine tea infusers&lt;/a&gt; - Some teas are jsut going to be made of smaller particles. An extra-fine infuser is agreat way to not need to chew your drink. I use mine basically exclusively for the japanese sencha that is more shredded than mos tof my other loose teas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hario teaware - Hario’s teaware is made of borosilicate glass, which is heat resistant and beautifully clear. I use this &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hario-usa.com/products/maru-chacha-kyusu-tea-pot&#34;&gt;ChaCha Kyusu Maru Tea Pot&lt;/a&gt; all the time. I don’t know why they call it a Kyusu when basically all other kysus have the perpendicular handle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teaware.house - A great place to find all kinds of teaware. I have a couple pieces from here that I absolutely love. &lt;em&gt;(Edit 5/2025: It looks like Yunnan Sourcing has bought out Teaware.house!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond all of these, teware is really ubiquitous. Local pottery galleries are almost guaranteed to have interesting cups or mugs for sale. You might even know someone who can throw a classic tea cup or matcha bowl together for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wrapping-up&#34;&gt;Wrapping up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well over three thousand words later, I hope I was able to give you a little bit more context and some resources for what to look for and how to get started. It’s both an incredibly deep topic and also kind of rediculous to turn into a hobby, but I think there’s a tea out there for everyone and it really isn’t very hard to get started or eventually improve your methods. I hope you have nothing but an excellent time exploring your own taste and preferences in tea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hang-on-what-about-sleepytime-mate-rooibos&#34;&gt;Hang on what about sleepytime? Mate? Rooibos?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, look. I know I said I’d only talk about real tea here. I’m really not trying to gatekeep or anything. Tea is already such a broad topic that I cannot in good faith address everything with the same depth. Here’s the short version:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleepytime tea is made by Celestial Seasonings. It’s chamomile. Chamomile isn’t tea. It’s a different plant entirely. Sleepytime and most other teas made by Celestial seasonings are actually Herbal Teas, basically herbs that can be brewed like tea, but aren’t real tea. Herbals can have wildly varied flavors, brewing instructions, and are naturally caffiene free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rooibos is becoming more popular pretty rapidly. This comes from a plant native to southern Africa. It has an earthy flavor reminiscent of tobacco, apparently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yerba Mate is a high-caffiene drink from South America brewed from a plant related to holly. It tends to be vegetal and grassy in flavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See? None of these are Tea really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. Like what you like. It’s cool.&lt;/p&gt;
